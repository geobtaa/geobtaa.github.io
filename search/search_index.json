Borchert Map Library, University of Minnesota</p> <p>Mapping Prejudice is mobilizing people of all ages and backgrounds to map racial covenants. Racial covenants are legal clauses in property deeds that barred people who were not white from buying or even occupying certain parcels of land. The project has developed an innovative methodology to map these covenants while catalyzing community conversations. The result is a digital, interactive map. The process of making that map \u2012 and the dataset that undergirds it \u2012 has proven a powerful vehicle for social change. Those who contribute to the map are forced to confront structural racism. Covenants are irrefutable examples of racially discriminatory practices. Engagement with these documents drives participants to identify systems-level solutions to contemporary housing problems. In addition to this mobilization, the map and the dataset are invaluable resources for policymakers and researchers who want to demonstrate how structural racism perpetuates inequalities. This talk will describe the project and its methods, cartographic and otherwise, and the social progress made, so far, toward a more honest future.</p> </li> <li> <p>Homegoing: The Technology of Living Spatial Data and Black Public Mourning in the Age of COVID-19</p> <p>Dr. Kim Gallon, Associate Professor of History, Purdue University</p> <p>This project is a spatial visualization of COVID-19 mortality data based on race.

In comparison to traditional survey and census-based data collection that is expensive and labor intensive to conduct, Twitter offers one of the newest, most rapidly growing, and accessible Big Data streams and has drawn interest from disciplines such as computer science, transportation planning, urban studies, public health, and behavioral science. As the data are generated from a massive group of individuals across the globe in real time, Twitter data have great potential for understanding various population dynamics. However, as evidenced in many existing studies, the use of Twitter data suffers from their mis-representativeness of the population and we know little about the characteristics of the users, such as the composition of demographic and complex user behaviors. This presentation will introduce Twitter data, evaluate their biases, discuss the usefulness of Twitter data for social science research, and introduce the Twitter data resources and capacity at the Computational and Spatial Analysis Core of the Pennsylvania State University. </p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"conference/2020/#agriculture-and-natural-sciences","title":"Agriculture and Natural Sciences","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Understanding the Disturbance of Human Recreation on Wildlife using Multiple Dynamic Agents within an IBM Framework</p> <p>Soraida Garcia, Purdue University</p> <p>Human recreation within outdoor landscapes is growing, and the extent and intensity of the impact of such activities upon the wildlife are increasing. The presence of humans may increase risk averse behavior by wildlife, restricting the access of wildlife to essential resources. Understanding the impacts of recreating humans upon wildlife is a complex challenge that is dependent upon the wildlife species and human activity types. This can be improved by combining results from empirical studies with simulation models to extrapolate mechanisms and investigate their implications. We developed an IBM modeling framework, that enables both dynamic virtual human and wildlife agents to change their actions based upon their state as a consequence of their interactions with their environment and other virtual agents. We use this framework to model the disturbance of birds, in the Lawrence Creek Forest Unit (LCFU), IN, by human recreation. We parameterize the model with human recreation data collected through an intercept survey of recreationists and bird data from published studies. By incorporating GIS mapping, we are able to simulate various scenarios of alternative trail spatial configurations. Our results indicate that birders influence the rates of disturbance of birds and the energy provided to nesting birds. Interestingly, simulations with imposed static human behavior rather than dynamic human agents estimated a much lower impact of birders on the disturbance of birds. This comparison illustrates the value of simulating human and wildlife agents in dynamic ways and demonstrates a better approach to understanding the conflicts between human recreation and wildlife.</p> </li> <li> <p>Deforestation in the Agricultural Landscape: Impacts on Water Quality in Indiana</p> <p>Shourish Chakravarty, Yangyang Wang, Mo Zhou, Purdue University</p> <p>Indiana is primarily an agricultural state with about half of its land utilized for growing crops, mostly in the northern region. High concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus, and pesticide residues due to agricultural runoff not only deteriorate the quality of surface and ground water within the state, but also contribute to pollutions as far as in the Gulf of Mexico. Forests in this intensive agricultural landscape, therefore, play a pivotal role in reducing runoff and purifying water, especially in areas with high hydrogeologic and aquifer sensitivity. In this study, we quantified changes in forest cover between 2008 and 2018 in Indiana and estimated their impacts on water quality. Cropland Data Layer, a crop-specific land cover data based on satellite imagery and ground truth, was used to obtain information of land use change for the study region. It is found that although the total forest area has remained relatively unchanged, there have been some significant reductions in forest cover around farmlands in the north. We applied the InVEST Water Purification Nutrient Retention model to estimate the impacts on water purification attributed to such changes.

Early detection of poor emergence and replanting decisions are critical for maximizing profit because grain yield decreases as planting is delayed. The objective of this research is to determine the ability of sUAS to assess soybean emergence as it relates to optimal plant population and growth stage. Large-scale field studies (~20 ha) were established at 4 locations in Indiana. Two commercially popular varieties of soybean with differing relative maturity were planted at 5 seeding rates (123,500, 247,000, 370,000, 494,000, 617,500 seeds ha-1). These treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block design with 3 to 5 replications. Aerial imagery was collected at two altitudes with a RGB (red, green, blue) camera equipped to a sUAS at multiple stages throughout the crops vegetative growth. Targeted sampling locations were selected using LiDAR derived terrain maps. Targeted sample imagery was collected at low altitude (&lt; 22 m), where transects were flown perpendicular to the plot direction, collecting subsamples (4 to 5 images) of each plot. These images were co-registered to whole-field orthomosaics which were constructed from high altitude flights (&gt;75 m). Each target subsample location was ground referenced to determine actual plant population. Imagery of locations with known plant populations were subjected to processing then used for comparing canopy coverage values from low altitude (&lt;22 m) and greater altitude (&gt;75 m) aerial imagery to evaluate the importance of spatial resolution in assessing soybean plant population with a RGB sensor. </p> </li> <li> <p>Development of soil and land cover databases for hydrologic modeling in Arequipa, Peru</p> <p>Fariborz Daneshvar, Jane Frankenberger, Laura Bowling, Keith Cherkauer, Johann Alexander Vera Mercado,  Purdue University Martin Juan C. Villalta Soto, Universidad Nacional de San Agustin</p> <p>Spatially complete GIS data sets of land cover and soil properties are needed to effectively run hydrologic models such as the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). However, data suitable for SWAT simulations, which requires a detailed set of properties by layer for the entire area of interest, are not readily available in many regions around the world. In this study, GIS maps and databases needed for the ArcSWAT, the ArcGIS interface of SWAT, were developed for the Peruvian Andes region. Soil maps that lacked detailed layer-based properties were combined with point soil profile information in an innovative method that defined soil classes based on a combination of two maps of soil taxonomy and suitability. Through this process, 172 soil classes were mapped, with 15 properties set for each class. For the land cover dataset, maps of land cover exist for the region, but required properties based on Andes vegetation were not available. Therefore regional climate maps and remotely sensed satellite data were used to estimate parameters such as the maximum leaf area index that controls the seasonal cycle of local vegetation. Spatially complete GIS data for estimated physical properties of soil and land cover classes will be posted on the Purdue University Research Repository (PURR) as a freely available resource to support hydrologic modeling in Arequipa, Peru. </p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"conference/2020/#gis-infrastructure","title":"GIS Infrastructure","text":"<ol> <li> <p>A quick tour of our Nation's Geodetic Infrastructure</p> <p>Jeff Jalbrzikowski, Ohio State University</p> <p>Join the National Geodetic Survey\u2019s (NGS) Appalachian Regional Advisor Jeff Jalbrzikowski, P.S., GISP, CFS, as he provides a glimpse into our nation\u2019s geodetic infrastructure, the framework that makes efficient GIS analysis possible.

Campus disruptions from COVID-19 forced us to pivot quickly to a remote installation. The learning curve associated with that pivot illustrated where our planning went well and where we needed to improve. GIS has a two decade history at Purdue Facilities. GIS platforms have ranged from Bentley Geographics to ESRI ArcMap. Support and approval to move to ArcGIS Enterprise required collaboration with our IT partners and senior leadership to complete a return on investment (ROI) exercise and project charter. The outcomes of both set our project priorities and expectations. That focus allowed us to identify specific potential cost savings. Since deployment, ROI priorities and the project charter continue to lead development. Our primary objectives are improving data management, GIS content accessibility and reducing technical debt. As a result, we provide more efficient and effective stewardship of facilities assets. Our analysts have been working since July 2020 to build our ArcGIS Portal, create and manage Portal user groups, and create content and resources for the campus community. They serve as de facto educational and PR contacts for our growing number of users while furthering ongoing campus operations. Purdue University is Indiana\u2019s land grant university. The work we do maintains its lands, facilities and infrastructure. Thorough planning enabled us to support Purdue\u2019s needs in unprecedented circumstances.

The project studied individual, family, and neighborhood characteristics that enabled households to come out of the poverty trap. The research needed temporal data on poverty and socioeconomic characteristics that were spatially harmonized to account for changes in the sub-county geographies since 1970s.  The Purdue research team used crosswalks developed by Brown University and filled-in the spatial data for un-tracted rural areas for 1970 and 1980 to develop a consistent GIS database for five decades. This effort resulted in approximately 72,000 spatially harmonized tracts in the U.S., and 17,000 tracts across the 12 states of the North Central Region for the 1970-2016 time period. The \u201cDimensions of Poverty\u201d interactive website \u2013 comprised of charts and maps \u2013serves 12 states that comprise the North Central Region. The story map presents key demographic and economic data including harmonized poverty variables and displays areas of high and persistent poverty in the region.  The web-based reports analyze three dimensions of poverty (high poverty, persistent poverty and child poverty) and present data in concise and visually rich way. The Story Map is being explored by various federal, state, and regional agencies in Indiana and beyond to make informed decisions pertaining to economic development.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"conference/2020/#break","title":"BREAK","text":"<p>11:30 - 11:50 EST / 10:30 - 10:50 CST</p>"},{"location":"conference/2020/#lightning-talks","title":"LIGHTNING TALKS","text":"<p>11:50 - 12:30 EST / 10:50 - 11:30 CST</p> <ol> <li> <p>What is geodesy and why is it important to you? </p> <p>Jeff Jalbrzikowski, Ohio State University</p> <p>Join the National Geodetic Survey\u2019s (NGS) Appalachian Regional Advisor Jeff Jalbrzikowski, P.S., GISP, CFS, for a lightning talk on geodesy and why utilizing modern datums is important for all geospatial professionals.</p> </li> <li> <p>Impact of Emerald Ash Borer and Forest Structure on Understory Plant Invasion</p> <p>Jessica M.

My research takes advantage of GIS, remote sensing, and Big Data to address a critical environmental issue. More specifically, I utilize a combination of ArcGIS mapping software, aerial light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and Continuous Forest Inventory (CFI) ground data to assess the potential impacts of Emerald Ash Borer (Agrilus planipennis) and forest structure on understory plant invasion. ArcGIS allowed for the selection and visualization of forest ash (Fraxinus spp.) plots across Indiana, and along with statewide continuous LiDAR and plot level CFI data, I created a comprehensive image of the forested landscape. My preliminary results illustrated that taller and more heterogeneous canopies are related to lower invasive species richness and potentially show some degree of biotic resistance. Future research will focus on using the spatial capabilities offered by ArcGIS in tandem with the quantitative analyses that can be performed with LiDAR and CFI metrics to detect landscape-level invasive response. Unique structural changes can be measured with the two LiDAR time points with the goal of enhancing our understanding of the way invasion can alter or be altered by the spatial arrangement of a canopy. </p> </li> <li> <p>Geospatial analysis of light pollution and house vacancy during the COVID-19 outbreak</p> <p>Qing Su, Jie Shan, Purdue University</p> <p>The outbreak of COVID-19 has caused various socioeconomic changes in the country, especially in metropolitan cities. One effective information source that can reveal such changes is the NASA nighttime light (NTL) data product that has daily update at a spatial resolution of 500 m. This study uses the seasonal-trend-decomposition procedure to analyze the light pollution time series deviations in Chicago. Another utility of NTL data product is the calculation of house vacancy rate (HVR) in combination with land cover data. The estimated HVR is compared with the statistical HVR data from US Census Bureau for validation. Through this study, we found out that the light pollution change since COVID-19 outbreak was successfully modeled by the seasonal-trend-decomposition procedure and the estimated HVR was strongly correlated with the Census statistical data before and after the outbreak. Such results reflect the overall decreased trend of light pollution generated by less human nocturnal activities, due to the stay-at-home order. In Chicago, the light pollution increases during the first two months of 2020 (up to 15.3% in the same month compared with 2019), but sharply decreases in March (12% decrease in the same month compared with 2019), and slightly goes up in the second quarter.

The described architecture presents considerable cost, data ownership, and security concerns.  This paper presents an alternative architecture wherein many inexpensive monitoring and incident detection devices read and process sensor data and communicate pertinent information by radio link to a single internet connected hub that forwards information to a central server.  The server then notifies client applications that support work zone monitoring and incident response.  From a field test of the radio units in an active work zone, the effective transmission range was found to be 3 km.  All devices in a work zone up to 6 km in length could be serviced by a single internet connected base receiver station centered within it.  Prototype devices were created using readily and inexpensively available sensors for microcontrollers.  An example dashboard was created to show real time work zone device and sensor information on a mapping interface.  This project shows how use of connected work zone devices can be expanded at low costs using commonly available hardware and skills with a simplified architecture and encapsulated complexity from the standpoint of work zone management personnel while retaining data ownership.</p>"},{"location":"conference/2021/#lunch-break","title":"Lunch Break","text":"<p> 12:00 - 1:00 CST / 1:00 - 2:00 EST</p>"},{"location":"conference/2021/#keynote-address-by-dr-tracy-kugler","title":"Keynote Address by Dr. Tracy Kugler","text":"<p> 1:00 - 2:00 CST / 2:00 - 3:00 EST</p> <p>Facilitator: Melinda Kernik, University of Minnesota</p> <p>Bio: Dr. Tracy Kugler joined the Minnesota Population Center at the University of Minnesota in 2011 as the Project Manager for Terra Populus (now IPUMS Terra).

Understanding movement is critical to expanding theories in the spatial sciences and has important applications for fields including ecology, economics, transportation, and social interaction. This talk provides an overview of the open-source DynamoVis 1.0 software for the visualization of movement data and related environmental variables. The design of DynamoVis is based upon the cartographic framework for representing movement by Dodge (2020), which considers the representation of the cartographic space, the components of movement (object, location, time, attributes), visual variables for encoding movement, and interface considerations including display forms and interaction. DynamoVis allows scientists and educators to easily explore and represent complex movement data in a powerful visual interface, with additional considerations relating to the representation of dynamic phenomena and the related spatial context. This window into complex movement data enables intuitive data exploration, the use of visual variables to highlight patterns and spatial relationships, and hypothesis generation informed by visual analysis. Additionally, DynamoVis can be used as a communication tool for collaboration across disciplinary domains or as a teaching tool for scientific reasoning, as it allows built-in recording and export of dynamic visualizations of tracking data within the environmental context.</p>"},{"location":"conference/2021/#3-using-climate-models-to-assess-spatio-temporal-crime-behavior-in-cities","title":"3.

Predicting species range in response to variation in climate is a goal shared among the fields of both conservation and evolutionary ecology. Species distribution models (SDMs) are visual representations of simulated spatial and temporal patterns of a species in response to predictor variables (PVs), making them useful tools for predicting a species\u2019 range for extrapolated future climate scenarios. As rapid environmental change is experienced, animals must adapt to changes in their environment at a minimum of the same rate, lest they risk extinction. Range shifts and adjustments in movement strategies are mechanism of coping with climate change, and SDMs give insight into how these mechanisms may play out in natural populations\u2014information that may be used to forecast population dynamics and persistence. A better understanding of where, when, and how species distributions are shaped provides valuable information to conservation practitioners, evolutionary ecologists, and policy makers for decision-making regarding habitat and species management.

We used the example of Milwaukee, Wisconsin a historically segregated city to show how Federally sanctioned residential segregation in the 1930\u2019s is still reflected in health inequities in socioeconomic health metrics today. We used ArcGIS Pro to map several community socioeconomic metrics such as children in poverty, homeownership rates, and those who have completed high school, as well as historically redlined neighborhoods, against access to high-speed broadband to show the spatial patterns. We then transformed these maps into several GIFs, shared in an article on the County Health Rankings and Roadmaps website and social media platforms, to help users better overlay the different metrics. We find, unsurprisingly, that census tracts with lower percentages of broadband access are correlated with those in which more children live in poverty, fewer individuals own their homes or graduated high school, and were more likely to be redlined in the past. These findings highlight the existence of digital redlining and point to the need to reduce the inequity in broadband access to avoid further harm to communities experiencing disinvestment. </p>"},{"location":"conference/2022/#overcoming-the-challenges-of-developing-a-geospatial-database-for-longitudinal-study-of-urban-childhood-obesity","title":"Overcoming the challenges of developing a geospatial database for longitudinal study of urban childhood obesity","text":"<p>David Tulloch, Rutgers University; Kristen Lloyd, Rutgers University; Michael Yedidia, Rutgers University; Derek Delia, Rutgers University; Robin DeWeese, Arizona State University; Francesco Acciai, Arizona State University; Punam Ohri-Vachaspati, Arizona State University</p> <p>Childhood obesity is a complex problem to which a child's environment contributes significantly.

Agroforestry is seen as one solution that has been promoted by numerous agencies and organizations to improve food and livelihood security without undue negative impacts on the environment. While this technology exists in many forms and has been practiced in specific locations across Africa for generations, the widespread adoption and \"up-scaling\" of agroforestry requires consideration of whether the agroforestry planting scheme and key specie(s) included within that scheme are not only suitable for a given ecosystem but also if cultural practices/traditions in an area will favor up-take. GIS-based Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is an effective tool for structuring and evaluating criteria for decision support, through there is a noted absence in current literature illustrating the integration of cultural legacy or indigenous knowledge into MCDA, particularly in settings where field survey of individuals or societies is not an option. In such a case, the implementation of a methodological framework for gleaning cultural legacy or indigenous knowledge from ethnographic works and other pertinent research is critical for developing an output of suitability that is culturally appropriate. This project is structured to illustrate how topological, ecological, and cultural criteria can be integrated in GIS-MCDA for the assessment of plantain-based agroforestry site suitability in Uganda. By accounting for cultural criteria in MCDA suitability analysis and identifying sites where cultural traditions favor a given intervention, the potential for up-take of promoted interventions is likely to be improved. </p>"},{"location":"conference/2023/#new-jersey-state-regulatory-riparian-zone-map","title":"New Jersey State Regulatory Riparian Zone Map","text":"<p>Kate Douthat, Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey; Larry Torok, New Jersey DEP</p> <p>This map shows the locations and widths of regulatory riparian zones of the streams of New Jersey according to the Flood Hazard Area Control Act (FHA) Rules (N.J.A.C 7:13-4.1). The FHA designates riparian zones around streams, inside of which development and land disturbance is limited in order to protect target species, habitat, and water quality. The width and upstream extent of the buffer is based on state Surface Water Quality Standards and the location of habitat for endangered and threatened species.

Riparian zones had to be interpreted directly from the text of the rules\u2014a complicated task for most users.  Some technical issues we encountered when making this map included reconciling different sets of stream centerlines and creating isodistances with ESRI\u2019s new Trace Network tool. Other challenges included reconciling data definitions and regulatory definitions.

This project analyzes the movement of these specimens through space in order to understand how specimen collection is situated or complicated in the ongoing legacy of colonial science. Using georeferenced specimen records from natural history collections in North America and Europe, we investigate clusters of specimen movement through history and ask whether the distance between collection and storage has lengthened or shortened.

Daily crime location data were categorized into several crime types based on the classification code developed by law enforcement agencies, then spatially aggregated at the census tract level to examine spatial and temporal correlations. The study tested the hypothesis that certain crimes increase with warmer temperatures while others rise with colder temperatures, and that higher temperatures predict higher crime overall. Urban climate data from the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) and public crime data will be compared to identify census tracts sensitive to seasonal temperature changes. The findings aim to help law enforcement, urban planners, and stakeholders locate areas susceptible to heat stress and develop interventions to reduce violence and structural racism in highly crime-prone neighborhoods.

In the Advance GIS Class (GEOG-G438/539) at Indiana University Bloomington in Fall 2023, we analyzed heat vulnerability in the top twelve high-populated counties, focusing on social and environmental equity. We tried to build a heat vulnerability index with socioeconomic data (e.g., age, race, ethnicity, income, education attainment, housing status) and physical environment variables (e.g., surface temperature, canopy cover, and imperviousness). The results highlight diverse disparities in heat vulnerability levels associated with demographic and socioeconomic status across Indiana.

The recent evolution of remote sensing technology has provided additional tools for monitoring the near-surface moisture of soil across the continental United States (CONUS). The aim of this study is to determine the importance of different environmental variables on downscaled soil moisture products by leveraging remote sensing soil moisture. This study analyzes soil moisture data derived from the NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive Level 3 (SMAP L3) satellite mission. For downscaling soil moisture data to a 1-kilometer resolution, ancillary variables including precipitation, antecedent precipitation index (API), mean temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, daytime range temperature (DTR), dew point temperature, soil texture, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), leaf area index (LAI), land use land cover, elevation, slope, and aspect is taken into account. To determine the optimal soil moisture value at any location, a machine learning model is used called random forest.

Spatial variability within fields and variable, unpredictable rainfall patterns make N a challenging nutrient to manage, with up to 65% of the nitrogen applied being lost to the environment. Post-emergence sidedress applications of N fertilizer can reduce N loss and improve plant uptake, so efficient and practical ways to identify maize N status at early maize growth stages is key to assessing plant N needs. The objectives of this study were to 1) compare spatial and spectral metrics for predicting biomass, 2) assess aerial imagery derived metrics for estimating N uptake and concentration, and 3) identify if integration of spatial metrics derived from UAV imagery integrated with spectral metrics from satellite imagery can improve N uptake prediction at early growth stages. To accomplish this, two large scale field trials were used for the study. Multispectral UAV (0.05 m resolution) and satellite imagery (3 m resolution) was acquired at early maize growth stages prior to the sidedress application of fertilizer treatments. Imagery was post-processed to calculate multiple vegetative indices and extract canopy cover fraction. Biomass samples were collected from pre-determined sampling areas to obtain dry matter weight and calculate N uptake. Regression analysis determined the relationship between biomass, nitrogen uptake, and metrics derived from UAV and satellite imagery. The results suggest that the integration of satellite and UAV imagery derived metrics can be used to assess maize N status in a time efficient way.</p> </li> <li> <p>Leveraging GIS Resources at Indiana University</p> <p>Katie Chapman, Indiana University</p> <p>At Indiana University, GIS is an essential component of the work done by many of our students, faculty, and staff.

Participatory mapping has been widely used in rural conservation contexts and place-network investigations are offering promising applications to urban street crime problems at the neighborhood level. We explore the application of place-network investigations of wildlife poaching and trafficking, a globally distributed type of nature crime, in and around Pu Mat National Park in Vietnam in 2023. Using repeated measures and participatory mapping with local stakeholders and crime data from conservation rangers and nongovernmental organizations, we used QGIS to map the distribution of crime sites, corruption spots, comfort spaces, and convergent settings. We then used descriptive statistics and point pattern analysis to identify spatial patterns of each type of location, LISA statistics for hotspot detection, and geographically weighted regression model to explain how attributes such as facility type, distance to road affect the clustering of crime associated locations. Preliminary results identify a range of neglected spaces and spatial network trends: corruption spots facilitate wildlife crime outside the protected area concentrated in towns and markets; comfort spaces are more widely dispersed within protected areas in comparison to convergence settings and corruption spots. Participatory spatial data collection methods can help identify neglected spaces, places, and their spatial relationships.

Moreover, the recent proliferation of illegal snare traps has escalated threats to this species, leading to higher mortality rates and physical injuries. Despite the severity of the situation and the threats to this endangered species, there remains a lack of information regarding the favored habitat traits of bears and the behavioral impacts of injuries caused by snare traps. To address this knowledge gap, we integrated high-resolution movement data from 15 GPS-collared bears with various environmental covariates to (i) model habitat suitability and (ii) determine the influence of snare-induced injuries on space-use patterns. We utilized Resource Selection Function to identify environmental variables impacting bears\u2019 habitat selection. The results were ranked on a scale from 1 to 10 and visualized as a habitat suitability map. Furthermore, our results revealed that injured bears show distinct habitat selection patterns compared to their non-injured counterparts. Injured bears tended to select less rugged terrains, likely attributed to mobility limitations resulting from snare-induced injuries. In addition, injured bears show stronger preference for areas closer to trails, potentially leading to increased future human-bear encounters and conflicts.

Additional authors: Luyu Liu, Ph.D., Auburn University; Harvey J Miller, Ph.D. The Ohio State University.</p> <p>Public transportation offers a sustainable, environment-friendly, and equitable mode of travel, particularly for marginalized and disadvantaged groups. However, the first-mile/last-mile (FMLM) access problem can pose significant challenges to its efficiency and ability to generate accessibility. An incomplete sidewalk network reduces transit accessibility by creating barriers, especially for sidewalk-reliant groups such as people with mobility disabilities, elderly, and school children. In this study, we develop new metrics to measure the impacts of sidewalk incompleteness on transit FMLM accessibility. Using data from Columbus, Ohio, USA, a typical mid-sized American city with an incomplete sidewalk network, we apply these measures and compare them to the sociodemographic characteristics of the neighborhood surrounding each stop. We find that the sidewalk network and high-quality sidewalk network have 45%-50% less spatial coverage around bus stops compared to street networks, respectively. 39% and 49% of bus stops provide access to fewer groceries and healthcare facilities, respectively, when following sidewalk networks. We observe that inner-city neighborhoods, despite being less affluent, often have better sidewalk access compared to affluent suburban areas. However, peripheral to city-center and less-affluent neighborhoods exhibit a cumulative burden with the poor sidewalk access that impacts access to essential resources such as groceries and health care. The research provides a direct and comparative measure of FMLM accessibility and suggests a strong linkage of urban morphology with sidewalk accessibility. This study calls for targeted sidewalk improvements and a nuanced understanding of accessibility gaps to promote equitable and efficient public transportation systems.</p>"},{"location":"conference/2025/#presentation-2-integrating-behavioral-science-with-spatial-modeling-to-target-fertilizer-reduction-campaigns","title":"Presentation 2: Integrating Behavioral Science with Spatial Modeling to Target Fertilizer Reduction Campaigns","text":"<p>\ud83d\udc64 Qian Lei-Parent, University of Connecticut.

This presentation describes a GIS-based approach that integrates predictions of household fertilizer use with N loading and transport models to estimate the potential for reducing N delivery to the Sound through behavior-change campaigns. Specifically, our approach integrates multiple models including: (1) econometric modeling that uses survey data and household characteristics to predict parcel-level residential lawn fertilizer applications, (2) a biological model that estimates the nitrogen loads applied to landscape from residential fertilizer application, (3) a spatially explicit nitrogen transport model (N-Sink) to predict nitrogen loads to LIS, and (4) contingent behavior modeling to examine willingness to reduce fertilizer use in response to prospective policy interventions.

The model\u2019s accuracy is tested using F1-score and Intersection over Union, which measure how well it detects legends and their locations. Results show that adding more examples improves accuracy up to a point, but too many examples cause the model to overfit, so it makes predictions less reliable.

These risks strain health systems, worsen air pollution, and threaten food and water security. The findings provide a data-driven foundation for policymakers, researchers, and urban planners to prioritize adaptation investments, especially in cities where the convergence of climate risks and rapid urbanization demands urgent action. This research underscores the need for improved climate data, particularly for sub-city analyses, to enhance urban resilience planning.

The development of maps has been fundamentally driven by the fear of the unknown and the creative impulse to manifest new worlds. Early cartography arose from anxieties surrounding uncharted territories, dangerous coastlines, and imagined landscapes. This transformed fear into actionable spatial knowledge, with creativity serving as a tool to discover what lay beyond the horizon. Once territories were mapped, the fear of loss, distortion, or reduction of these mapped territories spurred further technological advancements, fueled by creative problem-solving. Creative maps, Artistic maps, and counter-mapping projects, born from creative reimagination, challenge dominant narratives and shape public discourse. This creative reinterpretation of maps can foreground marginalized perspectives, fostering empathy, critical engagement, and influencing public opinion. The impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the world of maps, and its interplay with fear and creativity, remains a critical area of inquiry. Technology-led mapping remains an area of skepticism and fear due to the potential risks of data breach, algorithmic bias, and surveillance. This talk discusses the convergence of fear, creativity, and AI to explore a previously neglected perspective on the world of maps. By analyzing maps through the lens of fear and creativity, we can gain fresh insights and stimulate new ways of thinking about the role and significance of maps, which are essentially visual narratives of the known and unknown.</p> </li> <li> <p>Conservation on a Slippery Slope: Using GIS and Remote Sensing to Predict and Prevent Land Degradation</p> <p>\ud83d\udc64 Ethan Bledsoe, Northwestern University</p> <p>Amidst Ecuador\u2019s cloud forests, where conservation and development collide, soil erosion threatens biodiversity and local communities. Using ArcGIS Pro, Google Earth Engine (GEE), Python, and high-resolution remote sensing, I mapped erosion risks in Manduriacu, a region where steep slopes and land-use changes endanger fragile ecosystems. By integrating these outputs into the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), I quantified erosion risk through key factors: R-factor (rainfall erosivity), K-factor (soil erodibility), LS-factor (slope steepness and length), C-factor (land cover), and P-factor (conservation practices). My analysis pinpointed severe soil loss near roads, deforested areas, and the Manduriacu Hydroelectric Dam, where infrastructure has destabilized surrounding slopes. By overlaying my results with hydrological flow accumulation models, I identified sediment transport pathways threatening local waterways. Field validation with conservation rangers confirmed exposed root systems and degraded slopes in high-risk zones, strengthening the model\u2019s predictive accuracy. To enhance this analysis, I used GEE\u2019s cloud-based processing to automate NDVI classification, linking vegetation loss trends to topographic and hydrological factors. Leveraging Sentinel-2 imagery, I conducted NDVI time-series modeling, applying linear, spline, and moving average interpolation to detect vegetation loss patterns over time. These insights directly informed Fundaci\u00f3n Ecominga\u2019s reforestation priorities by pinpointing degraded areas most in need of intervention, optimizing efforts to stabilize slopes and restore biodiversity. In this talk, I\u2019ll explore how geospatial analysis transforms conservation planning \u2014 demonstrating how satellite-driven NDVI forecasting, cloud computing, and erosion modeling can bridge the gap between remote sensing and on-the-ground reforestation strategies to protect Ecuador\u2019s cloud forests.    </p> </li> <li> <p>Teaching about Communities: Integrating Open Geospatial and Map Resources into Projects</p> <p>\ud83d\udc64 Tara Anthony, Penn State University</p> <p>This session will highlight course activities, instructional initiatives, and library engagement activities focused on community projects using open government geospatial, maps, and GIS resources.

Ecological and genomic attributes of populations can provide two orthologous perspectives on the biological profiles associated with conservation challenges. Together, GIS and modern genomics help identify the environmental and genomic conditions that should maximize fitness and thus population productivity. Here, I illustrate representative approaches to combine GIS and population genomics. I first introduce recent approaches that combine modern genomics and ecological niche modeling to identify and conserve local adaptation profiles. I then introduce the idea of distilling genomic information into thematic GIS layers. This integration of genomics into GIS thematic layers will help convey the implications from genomic datasets to nonspecialists to help better inform applied conservation management and associated policy. I provide several examples relevant for conservation, including my own research, that illustrate how this integration of GIS + modern population genomics could be realized.</p> </li> <li> <p>Developing the Washington State Food Rescue Map</p> <p>\ud83d\udc64 Mariah Rubin, University of Washington</p> <p>Food insecurity and food waste are persistent challenges in Washington state. Over 2 million residents face food insecurity, while more than 1 million tons of food waste\u2014including 390,000 tons of edible food\u2014are generated annually (Use Food Well Washington Plan, 2022). Food rescue presents a solution to reduce food waste and improve food security. In 2015, the Washington state legislature set a goal to cut edible food waste by 50% by 2030, tasking the Department of Ecology (DOE) with tracking progress. However, scattered data and limited tools have hindered these efforts.   Our University of Washington team developed the Washington State Food Rescue Map with the best available data to support DOE\u2019s mandate to collect and monitor food waste reduction efforts, identify data gaps, and support opportunities for preventing food waste through food rescue. Our team leveraged the expertise of hunger relief organizations across Washington by conducting a survey and in-depth interviews. This provided insights for assessing their current food rescue practices and capacity to accept food donations, identifying barriers and opportunities for improving and expanding food rescue, validating the map\u2019s data layers, and understanding how the map could rescue more food.

This research explores the use of ArcGIS Pro\u2019s deep-learning models to analyze high-resolution satellite imagery, aiming to identify vehicles and classify them as either moving or parked. By leveraging existing pre-trained models and retraining them with supervised data from the target urban area, we achieve a workflow tailored to the city\u2019s unique conditions. Georeferenced satellite imagery with an inherent coordinate system ensures that each detected vehicle\u2019s location is accurately mapped, streamlining the process of spatial analysis.  To distinguish moving from parked vehicles, spatial context plays a pivotal role. Parking lot boundaries and street parking zones are integrated into the analysis, allowing vehicles detected within these areas to be classified as stationary. In contrast, vehicles in known travel lanes or away from parking zones are more likely to be moving. The research demonstrates how geospatial features combined with deep learning output can produce reliable vehicle state classifications, without the need for time-sequenced imagery.  This method represents a scalable, efficient approach to urban vehicle monitoring, contributing valuable insights for urban planners and transportation managers. It highlights how off-the-shelf deep-learning capabilities, enhanced with domain-specific training data, can be applied to solve real-world challenges. The results lay the foundation for more sophisticated analyses, such as traffic flow optimization and parking demand prediction, supporting smarter, more responsive cities.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"conference/2025/#session-3-gis-for-equity-and-engagement","title":"Session 3: GIS for Equity and Engagement","text":"<p>\ud83d\udd5a 3:00 - 4:00 CST</p> <p>Facilitator: Karen Majewicz, University of Minnesota; Slide Operator: Sue Oldenburg, Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey</p>"},{"location":"conference/2025/#presentation-1-map-making-fostering-gis-and-makerspace-inquiry-through-a-collaborative-data-physicalization-project-at-a-liberal-arts-college","title":"Presentation 1: Map Making: Fostering GIS and Makerspace Inquiry through a Collaborative Data Physicalization Project at a Liberal Arts College","text":"<p>\ud83d\udc64 Tracy Tien, Wellesley College; Additional authors: Allegra Dufresne, Wellesley College; Johanna Okerlund, Wellesley College</p> <p>We conducted a multi-year initiative to engage the Wellesley College community with interdisciplinary GIS and making methods through a participatory data physicalization activity that transformed a library hallway wall into a large-scale map.

The work was done using the Public Land Survey System (PLSS), which divides land into six-mile square townships and one-mile square sections. It established the township, range and section grid; the pattern upon which land ownership and land use is based. The aim of the survey was to divide the land into lots that could be sold, or otherwise divested, to raise funds for the federal government and to encourage settlement. In general, this work took place near the end of the 18th century and throughout the 19th century. Survey dates for specific plats vary depending on the state/region.</p> <p>The survey work was done by the General Land Office (GLO), an agency of the Treasury Department until 1849 and thereafter a part of the Interior Department. In 1946, the GLO was merged with the Grazing Service to create the modern Bureau of Land Management (BLM), which continues to have responsibility for the Public Land Survey on public domain lands. The original surveys are often referred to as the Public Land Survey or the General Land Office Survey. </p> <p> </p> Example of a PLSS plat for the State of Minnesota showing T027N R20W https://geo.btaa.org/catalog/t027r20w4fi01"},{"location":"guides/plss/#field-survey-notes","title":"Field Survey Notes","text":"<p>The work of the public land surveys was recorded in small notebooks that became the official record.

In recent years, ArcGIS Hub / Open Data Portals have emerged as the most popular publishing application for geospatial data providers. While this platform excels with user experience and data accessibility, it enables problematic publishing practices that contribute to link rot.  Additionally, when migrating a dataset between the ArcGIS suite of products, it is very easy for the metadata to get lost.</p> <p>This guide presents publishing workflows that improve the stability of data identifiers and maximize benefits from metadata of resources on ArcGIS Hub / Open Data Portals.</p> <p>Stable data identifiers prevent URL links from breaking for those who are using your data dynamically in web maps or for sites that aggregate resources.  They also reduce time required to maintain and update links within your own organizational website, protecting investment of time and labor in the resources you have created.</p> <p>Strong metadata workflows ensure that the context needed to trust and understand data stays associated with the resource.  When information about data collection steps are not written down or become separated from the data, data users are likely to be frustrated and more likely to use data incorrectly.  Losing track of metadata creates more work down the road for staff trying to answer questions from the public or others in the office about unfamiliar data. Metadata is also critical for making resources more discoverable within the open data environment.  Providing descriptive text about your data will make these resources much more likely to show up in searches within ArcGIS Online and Google.</p> <p>At the time of writing this guide, the best option for keeping metadata associated with data in ArcHub is to create metadata using ArcCatalog and then to upload individual shapefiles to ArcGIS Online through the Content Pane.  With this workflow, information specific to each data layer can be displayed on item pages and metadata is included with shapefile downloads.</p> <p>If your organization must publish data from a desktop platform (i.e. ArcMap or ArcGIS Pro), it is only possible to provide item description metadata for the entire service, not for individual layers.  Metadata cannot be automatically included with data downloaded from ArcGIS Hub.  A workaround is to \u201cenable metadata for your organization\u201d and then use the online metadata editor to make a separate metadata file available from the download dropdown in ArcGIS Hub.  This workaround also can be used in conjunction with other publishing workflows to provide additional metadata in alternative formats, such as a PDF or spreadsheet with attribute field definitions. </p> <p>If you do \u201cenable metadata for your organization,\u201d it will affect how metadata is displayed to users online when they \u201cView Metadata.\u201d  It will also affect the format of metadata in cases where it is available with shapefile downloads.

Unsurprisingly, out of approximately 1.7 million maps in this sample, over 85% are in English. However, this project can help us to identify instances in which our institutions may hold distinctive content based on the relative rarity of maps in particular languages, as well as possible collection strengths where institutions hold a relatively high number of maps in a given language. Both of these cases are worth further examination as candidates for potential local or collective scanning projects.</p> <p>Language is one aspect of a diverse map collection that can be a starting point for approaching other intersecting aspects, such as spatial coverage or creator identities (i.e., a non-English language map created by an individual or organization local to the area of interest). It also opens up opportunities for local collaboration (e.g., with area studies colleagues to identify shared opportunities in support of research, teaching, and learning and associated map scanning priorities) and collective collaboration (e.g., shared prioritization for multi-institution scanning projects to increase discovery and access of distinctive non-English language maps).</p> <p>There are relatively few non-English language maps in the geoportal currently (and these are not easily discoverable due to lack of language search/facet options), so map language provides one avenue to diversify our collections. For the most part, this will require participating institutions to make language a priority for future map scanning projects in ways that align with local collection development, research, and curricular interests. However, it also requires a critical reexamination and revision of our collection development policy, in which we specifically note an emphasis on English language content as a criterion in scoping the geoportal collection.</p> <p>Possible next steps stemming from this project include:</p> <ul> <li>Ensuring that language metadata is present and accurate for geoportal records.

At the time of review, there were also approximately 200 unique tags associated with these datasets, with examples such as policy, race, at risk, income, vulnerable populations, air quality, food environment, segregation, social justice, and many more. In addition to datasets, the Racial Equity GIS Hub includes many examples of formats not currently included in the geoportal, such as web applications and story maps.

A keyword field was included, listing the descriptive tags for each item. Unique keywords and their frequencies were identified using the Document Terms tool provided by Voyant Tools. After removing all document terms with only one associated record, the dataset was reduced from 9,106 unique terms to 4,687. After additional filtering to remove information discoverable through other geoportal facets (e.g., formal geographic names, creator names, dates) and abbreviations or misspellings, the final sample of unique terms was 2,917. These terms were cross-checked against the list of tags associated with the Racial Equity GIS Hub, and possible alternate terms were identified as well. This process, albeit a subjective one, resulted in a list of approximately 630 terms (including the Racial GIS Equity Hub tags) with possible relevance to equity and social justice datasets. Examples of terms used by current providers that were not represented in the Racial Equity GIS Hub include accessibility, child care, culture, economic development, election map, health care, human trafficking, open space, opioid, police, public service, sustainability, water quality, and many more.</p> <p>In addition, a sample of 18 current data provider sites representing state, county, and city administrative levels was reviewed for content being disseminated in formats such as web mapping applications, story maps, and dashboards.

Often referred to as attribute table definitions or codebooks, data dictionaries describe a dataset's internal structure and provide information for understanding its contents.</p> <p>In the past, our efforts have focused on descriptive metadata\u2013titles, authors, dates, subjects, etc.\u2013to help users find resources. We have devoted less attention to helping users evaluate resources. However, user feedback has consistently shown that data dictionaries are highly desired. Many users even assume this information is already included in metadata, leading to confusion when it is not readily available.</p> <p>The challenge of documenting data dictionaries has persisted for years. The earlier geospatial metadata standard, FGDC, provided a structured format for this information through its Entities and Attributes section. However, the subsequent ISO 191xx standards replaced this section with ISO 19110, a standalone format for data dictionaries. Despite this shift, ISO 19110 files remain rare, likely because tools like ArcGIS do not export field definitions in this format. One exception is Stanford Libraries, which include ISO 19110 files in their dataset downloads. However, these files are not available as previews in their geoportal and are encoded in XML, making them difficult for users to read.</p> <p>Accessing data dictionaries is often a frustrating process for users, as the information is inconsistently stored across FGDC files, plain text files, or external websites. To address this, we have consolidated the information into a standardized table format. Users can now access data dictionaries directly from the item view page via a clearly labeled link\u2014eliminating the need to search through XML files or external sources. </p> <p>Our data dictionary format is modeled on the FGDC standard. Using Python scripts, we extract field information from datasets or existing FGDC files and document it in simple CSV files. These CSVs are designed to accommodate nested entries by including a parent field identifier.</p> <p>While this approach has improved accessibility, many of our data dictionaries remain incomplete. In cases where field definitions are unavailable, we at least provide field names and types as extracted by our scripts. By storing this information in tables rather than static files, we retain the flexibility to update the dictionaries as new information becomes available. Even in their current state, these tables help users gain a clearer understanding of a dataset\u2019s contents simply by browsing the field names.</p> Screenshot of Data Dictionary preview (https://geodev.btaa.org/catalog/btaa-e4a8461e-6cd1-4c45-b6e8-5838bfe6bde3) Screenshot of data dictionary with nested values.

It aims to improve how geospatial data is collected, managed, and used to address challenges from local to global scales. The plan is built around three goals:</p> <ul> <li>Governance: Ensure inclusive participation, clear policies, and sustainable funding.</li> <li>Data and Technology: Modernize infrastructure, adopt advanced technologies like AI, and improve data quality and accessibility.</li> <li>People: Develop a skilled workforce, promote partnerships, and encourage geospatial literacy.</li> </ul> <p>It highlights trends such as AI, big data, open data, and privacy concerns, and emphasizes NSDI\u2019s role in areas like disaster response, smart cities, agriculture, healthcare, and infrastructure. Success depends on collaboration across sectors, coordinated through the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC).</p> <p>The National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI), as defined by the Geospatial Data Act of 2018, is the framework of technology, policies, standards, and personnel that supports geospatial data sharing across all levels of government and the private sector. Over the past 30 years, the NSDI has evolved from a federally led initiative to a collaborative, multi-sector effort. Key achievements include the development of governance structures, open data platforms, and geospatial tools, supported in part by the FGDC\u2019s Cooperative Agreements Program.</p> <p>Looking ahead, the NSDI must adapt to address pressing national challenges\u2014such as climate change, public health, and infrastructure\u2014by delivering timely, integrated, and AI-ready geospatial data. The 2025\u20132035 strategic plan envisions a shift from siloed systems to an interoperable geospatial ecosystem that supports real-time decision-making.

Geospatial web services depend on a server-side / client-side relationship. That server may be on premises or may utilize cloud-based infrastructure, and those clients can access, combine, and (in some cases) contribute information back to web services from different sources without the need for local hosting on their own infrastructure.</p> <p>Different types of geospatial web services exist, with two of the most common and relevant for our purposes being Web Feature Services (WFS) and Web Map Tile Services (WMTS).  </p> <ol> <li>A web feature service is a dynamic, read-only service useful for directly exposing data for display and querying in a web map or web mapping application. Example: Web Feature Service.  </li> <li>A web map tile service is a dynamic, read-only service that supports fast visualization from a collection of predrawn images (tiles) but does not allow direct access to data about individual features. Example: Web Map/Map Tile Service.</li> </ol> <p>The role of web GIS in the geospatial industry continues to expand and evolve, and it is in this context that geospatial web services have become an important mechanism for distributing geospatial information. By linking to a web service hosted by an authoritative data provider, users are able to display the most accurate and up-to-date information available in their web maps and applications.  This decreases duplicate versions that may become out of sync if corrections or updates are made by the data provider.  Geospatial web services can also pose a challenge though for users seeking to directly access the data on which those web services have been built, as a user\u2019s ability to download those data may be limited by the settings configured by the owner of that web service or, when the configurations allow for data querying/download, may require additional skills to carry out the necessary steps in a desktop GIS. </p>","tags":["2019","reports"]},{"location":"library/webServicesReport/#benefits-of-web-services","title":"Benefits of web services","text":"<p>Within the context of the BTAA geoportal project, providing web services would have a number of potential benefits:</p> <ol> <li>Ability to preview data before downloading.

It is an Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) compliant implementation of a number of open standards such as Web Feature Service (WFS), Web Map Service (WMS), and Web Coverage Service (WCS). Additional formats and publication options are available including Web Map Tile Service (WMTS) and extensions for Catalogue Service (CSW) and Web Processing Service (WPS).</p> <p>Resources and workflows</p> <p>As an open source platform, there is abundant documentation to provide guidance in implementation, development, and customization of GeoServer. One major benefit of this option would be the ability to test new releases and features before deciding to implement them locally.  While it does require dedicated maintenance, the web API is quite simple and there is an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) to store and manage data and create services. There is typically one dedicated \u201cworkspace\u201d where map layers are created -- both raster and vector data can be stored and hosted as services. There are very few (if any) file size limitations that would hinder certain datasets from being shared as a service (the limits that do exist are aimed at maintaining reliable draw performance/speed). Online documentation and an active user group within the GeoBlacklight community are available to offer guidance on automation and scripting for more efficient workflows. There is support for metadata within GeoServer -- simple records can be added in the GeoServer workspace, and more complex metadata (if available) can be uploaded separately. Unlike ArcGIS Online, Geoserver is not itself a discovery platform, so it  would not be necessary to transform and maintain metadata records to align with an additional schema. Existing BTAA GeoBlacklight metadata could be used to populate descriptions of web services.</p> <p>Implementation - distributed vs. centralized  Although the technical requirements and maintenance of GeoServer are not especially demanding, there must be dedicated IT support and server authorization permissions. Data files are stored in a database (i.e. PostGreSQL) with a client interface for uploading content. There are some advantages and challenges with both distributed and centralized implementation of GeoServer. </p> <p>Distributed  The notion that each participating BTAA institution would stand-up separate instances of GeoServer may not be practical, but it is not impossible. Unlike ArcGIS, GeoServer is not an already widely utilized tool  at BTAA institutions. It would have to be implemented as an addition to each University Library\u2019s existing technical infrastructure. However, a distributed model: (a) allows for local control over storage and management of the geospatial data needed to create web service layers; and (b) reduces negative performance issues by coupling the database environment with GeoServer locally.  It might also mean, though, that certain institutions may implement GeoServer and generate services for their locally-hosted data, while others simply do not have the IT infrastructure, expertise, or personnel to do so.</p> <p>Centralized  It could be possible for a single institution to implement an instance of GeoServer that others could be given permission to access -- but in a centralized model, challenges arise in the storage of data files used in the creation of the services themselves.  Geospatial data files must be stored (or archived) for a web service to be generated from them. A single GeoServer instance would struggle to function adequately when accessing data stored locally at institutions across the BTAA.  Based on an informative interview with Eliot Jordan at Princeton University (where they are actively using GeoServer and GeoBlacklight) service performance and IT security issues arise in a distributed environment. It is recommended that data files used to generate web services be stored in one location that is directly connected to GeoServer. This poses potential challenges for BTAA institutions in transferring data from one institution to another for the purpose of web service creation.</p>","tags":["2019","reports"]},{"location":"library/webServicesReport/#arcgis-online-httpswwwesricomen-usarcgisproductsarcgis-onlineoverview","title":"ArcGIS Online (https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-online/overview)","text":"<p>ArcGIS Online is a proprietary, cloud-based, enterprise web GIS platform. Organizational accounts for teaching and research use of ArcGIS Online are supported through Esri educational site licenses, though the number of named users, analysis/storage credits, and account management roles and responsibilities may differ across institutions. Whereas GeoServer is primarily an application for hosting and sharing geospatial web services, ArcGIS Online also serves as a discovery tool and visualization platform for creating maps and analyzing data. ArcGIS Online supports OGC-compliant web feature services (WFS), web map services (WMS) and web map tile services (WMTS), among others.</p> <p>Resources and workflows  There is abundant documentation available for publishing hosted layers and web services to ArcGIS Online. Organizational accounts come with access to Esri tech support services as well as to Esri training catalog resources. There are several different workflows for creating and publishing web services depending on the desired functionality and the type of service being created. For hosted feature services, one key consideration is a workflow for updating the maxRecordCount property, which defines the number of features that can be accessed when querying a web feature service or when downloading to create a local copy. For hosted tile layers, the recommended publication workflows are different depending on the size of the data set (less than or more than 1GB). While these are not file size restrictions per se, they are important to keep in mind for ensuring appropriate access to and efficiency of the hosted datasets in ArcGIS Online. The metadata workflows in ArcGIS Online are a bit more limited and more complicated than those for GeoServer. Currently, only the ArcGIS metadata format is supported for importing into ArcGIS Online. Furthermore, the specific publication workflow utilized for adding hosted layers to an ArcGIS Online account will influence the way that metadata is included with those items (see FAQ here for more detailed information about metadata publishing workflows).</p> <p>Implementation - distributed vs. centralized  While most contributing institutions have access to an institutional ArcGIS organization, task force members have different roles, responsibilities, and permissions in relation to their local instance. If a task force member moved to a different job, they may not be able to continue to host the web services they had uploaded to their institution\u2019s ArcGIS organization.  Changing ownership of content, especially between organizations, is challenging.  Because of this, we recommend web services generated specifically for the geoportal be uploaded to a centrally administered BTAA ArcGIS organizational account. </p> <p>Creating and distributing geospatial web services with ArcGIS Online would utilize Esri\u2019s cloud infrastructure rather than any local IT solution, so the distributed vs. centralized technology considerations outlined above for GeoServer do not necessarily apply. </p> <p>Task force members would be able to upload data and create services within the BTAA ArcGIS organizational account from dispersed locations. This could work well for research data held in institutional repositories, in cases where substantial curation is needed and in person communication with researchers preferable.  In other words, storage would be centrally managed, but the labor of creating certain types of web services would be distributed across task force members. For some types of data, it may make sense to use centralized workflows. Currently much of the public/open government data is accessioned by central project staff through automated processes. Trying to coordinate geoportal records generated through these processes with web services created by distributed task force members might prove to be complicated.   </p> <p>As the individual institutions participating in the BTAA geoportal project also have our own ArcGIS organizational accounts to support research and teaching, there is a separate question in regards to scope, i.e., which datasets/services might be hosted centrally in the BTAA organizational account vs. which may be hosted locally at our institutions. One way of approaching this could be based on if the geoportal task force member is directly responsible for creating the web services or if researchers at our respective institutions are creating and sharing the web services within our local ArcGIS organizational accounts. In the former case, the BTAA organizational account likely makes the most sense, especially as individual task force members cycle on or off of the project. In the latter case, the datasets/services may be hosted in local ArcGIS Online organizations, but records could still be created in the geoportal to facilitate discovery and access for these data.</p>","tags":["2019","reports"]},{"location":"library/webServicesReport/#collection-development-considerations","title":"Collection development considerations","text":"<p>Considerations for collection development as it applies to web service development would likely be undertaken by individual institutions (task force members) with guidance from the BTAA Collection Development Committee.

Decisions must be made item by item about how best to represent this geospatial data as a web service.

Example: Characterization of streams and rivers in the Minnesota River Basin Critical Observatory: water chemistry and biological field collections, 2013-2016</p> <p>Multiple data layers for a single record Data repositories often store all data layers related to a project together.

Datasets assigned public domain, CC0, or CC-By licenses may be appropriate as an initial focus, whereas CC-SA or CC-ND could be more complicated.  If the web services are being hosted from a centralized location, there are also could be questions around sharing research data between institutions.   Example: White-tailed deer density estimates across the eastern United States, 2008(Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 United States)  </p> <p>Special capacities (e.g. time-enabled layers)  Some data layers would be most useful (and true to their original purpose) if time-enabled, but it would take more work through more complicated workflows to create these web services.  Example: Reconstruction of North American Drainage Basins and River Discharge Since the Last Glacial Maximum </p> <p>Communicating with researchers/students/original data creators  Creating web services will require cartographic decision-making around the best way to display each dataset as a map or image.

This means the ability to  sync a service with the version of the dataset hosted by the original data creator will be difficult. As original data creators update, edit, or remove content from access online - there will be challenges in tracking what content we have generated web services for and whether or not they also need updating, editing, or deletion. The BTAA project essentially becomes the steward of a particular version of a public/open dataset when creating a web service for it.</p> <p>Curation  Creating web services for public/open data produced by state and local governments means a local copy of the data must be stored and hosted by the participating BTAA institution(s).  Content from original data creators would need to be reviewed item by item to determine the need for a web service.</p> <p>Licenses  There are some cases where licenses are not clearly assigned by the original data producer. Navigating access and use constraints for data with ambiguous licenses means direct communication with data creators may be required.  Our current metadata schema does not include liability statements or licenses.  If we were to become stewards of this data, we may need to expand the metadata elements we keep. </p> <p>Communicating with original data creators  There may be a need for a different model of communication with data creators if the BTAA Geoportal project plans to copy and display the original data as a web service.  The current model consists of simply adding an additional discovery mechanism to the information data producers are hosting themselves. Conversations on the best way to represent the data (cartographically) as a web service may also be necessary.  Formal channels of communication regarding data stewardship and representation may need to be established in a way that has not yet been fully explored by the BTAA project.</p>","tags":["2019","reports"]},{"location":"library/webServicesReport/#metadata-and-workload-considerations","title":"Metadata and workload considerations","text":"<p>In order to add web services to our current geoportal workflow,  more attention would need to be given to the metadata for those resources.  In addition to the Geoblacklight metadata currently being created for display in the Geoportal, we would need to locate and process copies of more comprehensive metadata when available.  Currently we rely on the original data source to provide supplemental information needed to make sense of data layers. But if we are keeping our own copy of data that will persist independently of the data provider, we will need to be more attentive to this information.  Comprehensive metadata is much less standardized and complicated than the more limited Geoblacklight schema, meaning that these steps will likely require a substantial amount of manual labor.  We will also need to track actions related to the stewardship of the individual data files.  We also might need to create a second set of discovery metadata for each web service if using the ArcGIS Online platform to host.  It is unclear who would be responsible for this work since it would be challenging to standardize these workflows steps between our distributed task force but time-intensive if performed by a centralized staff.  Below is a list of potential additional steps beyond our current process that may be needed to offer geospatial web services:</p> <ul> <li>Communicating with researchers or data providers to clarify ambiguous licenses and to select appropriate cartographic representations for the data  </li> <li>Downloading a snapshot of data to serve as the local copy supporting the web service   </li> <li>Creating additional metadata including administrative information tracking the download / processing of the web services data and relationship to the Geoblacklight metadata and (if hosting in ArcGIS) ArcGIS Item Description metadata  </li> <li>Creating web services either by  adding to a PostGreSQL database or uploading to ArcGIS Online  </li> <li>Adding new web service links to the related Geoblacklight metadata  </li> <li>Tracking modifications to the original dataset and making decisions about whether to reaccession to stay in sync or to continue linking to the snapshot</li> </ul> <p>We estimate that these additional steps could add 30 minutes to the processing time for an average item. </p>","tags":["2019","reports"]},{"location":"library/webServicesReport/#conclusions-recommendations","title":"Conclusions / Recommendations","text":"<p>Creating web services would provide a more consistent and satisfying user experience for interacting with geospatial data in the Geoportal.  In particular, it allows users to preview data even if they do not have access to geospatial software and before downloading files to their local device.  It may also encourage meaningful connections with faculty and students interested in ways to visualize and promote their research data.  Expanding the scope of the project in this way would require, however, a substantial increase in work for task force members and project staff.  Beyond the current process of creating discovery metadata for each data layer, the project would need to download a copy of each dataset, gather more detailed metadata, generate and link geoportal records to web services, and track modifications to the original dataset.  We estimate this could add up to 30 minutes to the processing time for the average item. </p> <p>One of the more important decisions to be made will be whether to take a more centralized or decentralized approach to creating web services.  If hosting content through Geoserver, a more centralized approach is recommended. This is because the services would need to be supported by a local database and it would be inefficient to set up servers at each partner institution.  If hosting through ArcGIS Online, a more decentralized workflow may be feasible.  This is because data and services would be stored in the cloud and any task force member would be able to upload data to the shared BTAA account.  More research needs to be done on the specifics of hosting using GeoServer before a recommendation can be made on the best technology option.  While GeoServer would take a greater infrastructure investment to set up and maintain, it would give us the greatest control over web service resources and the way they interact with the Geoportal.  ArcGIS Online would be comparatively easy to set up and administer, but we would have less control over performance and storage.  Also, since ArcGIS Online is itself a discovery platform, we would have to maintain metadata for both our Geoportal and their interface.  </p> <p>Creating web services would introduce a new set of challenges regarding how to maintain and represent data in the Geoportal.  For research data, there would need to be significant curation and item-by-item decision-making about how to best represent each project.  For public data, the most formidable problem will be how to keep web services accurate and non-duplicative as original data creators update, add, and remove content.  In both cases, creating web services may require a kind of engagement and conversation with data producers that we have previously skipped.</p>","tags":["2019","reports"]},{"location":"library/workgroup-reports/","title":"Workgroup reports","text":""},{"location":"library/workgroup-reports/#history","title":"History","text":"title creator date description subject source object_location BTAA GDP Accession Guidelines for ArcGIS Open Data Portals ArcGIS Working Group 2018-05 nan nan https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-zXMRKaT6MZEO18erXdN76y76QQzqMwGqygKKXFrLZU/edit?usp=sharing http://localhost:4000/objects/accession-guidelines-v1.pdf Analytics Working Group Final Report Analytics Working Group 2018-06 Report of what analytics information to collect for the BTAA Geoportal Working Group report; Analytics https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EA42kNs9R8ZeBznujSTQRHH5cbfgcbFV/view?usp=sharing http://localhost:4000/objects/analytics-report.pdf Best Practices for ArcGIS Hub/Open Data Portals ArcGIS Working Group 2018-06 This guide presents publishing workflows that improve the stability of data identifiers and maximize benefits from metadata of resources on ArcGIS Hub / Open Data Portals.

With the growing number of GIS datasets and digitized historical maps available, it can be challenging to locate the right resources since they are scattered across various platforms and not always tagged with the necessary metadata for easy discovery. To address this issue, the Big Ten Academic Alliance Geospatial Data Project launched in 2015 to connect scholars with geospatial resources.</p> <p>One of the primary outputs of the project is the BTAA Geoportal, a comprehensive index of tens of thousands of geospatial resources from hundreds of sources. The Geoportal enables users to search by map, keyword, and category, providing access to scanned maps, digital GIS data, aerial imagery, and interactive mapping applications. All of the resources available through the Geoportal are free and open, and the scanned maps cover countries around the world. Most of the data in the catalog is sourced from local governments, such as states, counties, and cities.</p> <p>The Geoportal is a useful tool because finding local geospatial data through a simple Google search can be difficult due to the lack of visibility of these datasets. The problem is that users need to know which agency is responsible for creating and distributing the data they are looking for and visit that agency's website to access the datasets. For instance, if you are researching a particular neighborhood in a city and need data on the roads, parks, parcels, and city council ward boundaries, you might need to check different state agencies, the city or the county website. But with the Geoportal, you can easily search by What, Where, and When without worrying about the Who or Why.</p> <p>The BTAA Geoportal helps scholars find and access geospatial resources from various sources, enabling them to focus on their research rather than the time-consuming task of finding the right data.</p>"},{"location":"technology/geoportal/#endorsements","title":"Endorsements","text":"<p>The following quotes are anecdotes from Task Force members about using the BTAA Geoportal</p>"},{"location":"technology/geoportal/#in-the-classroom","title":"In the Classroom","text":"<p>Quote</p> <p>Every semester I get invited to talk to a 200-level Geography course called \"Mapping your world\". I always highlight the Geoportal as a resource for finding spatial data as the students work on their end of semester group projects. Many of the groups research regional issues focused on the Midwest and have told me that they frequently use the Geoportal to find data. While new to mapping, students successfully find their data on the Geoportal, but they don't always realize what a valuable resource this is. However, an instructor who has been working in the field for decades really appreciates that so much spatial data has been aggregated into our Geoportal, and has been an advocate for the Geoportal in the classroom.</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>A nursing department professor reached out to us with the idea to develop content using the Geoportal for an online course. We created a tutorial for students to search for public health data in the Geoportal and visualize it in ArcGIS Online. The students were from all over the country and interested in finding public health related datasets from their own states. In addition to the Minnesota datasets and scanned map featured in the tutorial, the students also found public health related datasets for Wisconsin, Michigan, and Maryland.</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>I visited a Landscape architecture undergraduate class. For their capstone project, they needed to find information for a particular town or community of their own choice and design a new feature (such as parks, service center, etc.) according to their instructor. Many students (including international students) wanted to choose their out-of-state hometown for the project, but might not have known what agency or website to visit to find the information. The Geoportal solves this by providing a platform for them to search by place for their projects.</p>"},{"location":"technology/geoportal/#research-projects","title":"Research Projects","text":"<p>Quote</p> <p>A grad student was looking for GIS data for Twin Cities parks -- we used the Geoportal to search due to the map search option (combined with \"parks\" as a keyword). It turned out that St. Paul parks were part of a Ramsey County administrative boundaries data set, which would have been hard to locate with just text searching.</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>Kari is a graduate student in Anthropology. Her research interests are about how human encroachment influences the natural habitat in the Congo. She is learning GIS to prepare for her field trip and used the portal to find data in her research area, including administrative boundaries, roads, rivers, protected areas, mining, forest, populated areas, etc. It is hard to find this kind of related information from a simple Google map search, and the Geoportal helped her to explore her research question and prepare the background information before her field trip.</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>Joe A., an archaeologist, came to a Geography Awareness Week showcase that the University was putting on. I'd been invited to present that night, and I ended up talking about the Geoportal, but I didn\u2019t have a lot of time to answer questions because there were other presenters and a short time span. Anyway, Joe emailed me the next day saying that he went on the Geoportal and that he had everything from Boone County in just a few clicks.

The Big Ten itself has expanded, welcoming four new institutional partners in the past year. As we incorporate new geospatial resources from Washington, Oregon, and California into the BTAA Geoportal, our collection (already over 100,000 records) will continue to increase. At the same time, the BTAA-GIN Geodata Collection has introduced new demands for asset storage and metadata management. </p> <p>To keep pace, we have taken a step back to assess what is working, what needs improvement, and how we can continue to build and maintain a resilient, future-compatible technology framework. To guide this process, we articulated a set of Technical Values that embrace resilience, growth, community, and interoperability. </p> <p>With these principles in mind, we turned to identifying our core technology requirements, approaching the task as if we were starting from the ground up. At the top of our list is stable storage for both metadata and datasets that remains reliable regardless of changes to platforms or applications. In addition, we identified two essential tools: an administrative workflow system and a public-facing discovery interface. Our current technology stack meets these needs.</p> <p>What we lack, however, is a dedicated metadata service that operates independently of any single application. Our current technology stack functions as a silo, requiring all access and use to flow through the Geoportal. We envision a shared registry of geospatial metadata records that welcomes contributions from multiple stakeholders and supports broad reuse. Transitioning from a traditional catalog to a metadata service will allow us to repurpose and redistribute our records across a wider range of systems and uses. By making the metadata available through an API as easily parsable web services, any BTAA institutional service will be able to access, display, and build upon our shared collection.</p> <p>With this model in mind, we then evaluated our chosen discovery platform, GeoBlacklight. It has long been the cornerstone of our technology stack, but the version we use is aging, and the next major release introduces major changes that would require a time-consuming rebuild. Until now, few alternatives have offered comparable features. However, a new metadata API opens the door to a simpler, more adaptable Geoportal built on top of this service.  Given our evolving needs, especially around metadata lifecycle management and file storage, we asked ourselves: should we reinvest in GeoBlacklight, or is there a better path forward?</p> <p>Drawing on our Technical Values, core requirements, and current technology assessment, we created a Vision that emphasizes modularity, interoperability, and prioritizing data over specific software solutions. Many existing tools, including our metadata editor and Amazon S3 storage, will stay in place. New components, including a metadata API and a lightweight front-end application, will strengthen our ability to manage and serve geospatial information.</p> <p>This transition creates exciting opportunities. A modular architecture allows us to update or refine individual components without disrupting the entire system. Adopting modern, widely supported frameworks lowers barriers and encourages a broader range of contributors to participate. An API-driven approach makes metadata more accessible, supporting not just our Geoportal but other repositories and services across the BTAA and beyond. However, we also recognize potential risks. Departing from the established GeoBlacklight code base may reduce synergy with a community that has developed specialized geospatial features, and we will need to recreate or adapt these functionalities in our new framework. </p> <p>Ultimately, we believe this shift will provide increased stability, because it addresses two of our biggest, interrelated, vulnerabilities: our reliance on a single developer\u2019s specialized skill set and tying all of our resources to a single piece of open-source software. By adopting a modular, widely-used technology stack, we broaden our pool of potential collaborators and decouple our data from the inherent ephemerality of software. Moreover, this approach makes building lightweight discovery systems more accessible for any institution. As we evolve, we remain committed to promoting collaboration beyond GeoBlacklight by fostering a more inclusive, technology-agnostic \u201cGeo-Libraries\u201d community.</p> <p>This Strategic Technology Plan outlines our next steps, focusing on four priority projects that balance ongoing work with needed upgrades. Our roadmap centers on the 2025-26 fiscal year, setting the stage for a gradual evolution of our infrastructure. Testing and proof-of-concept development will begin in Q3 2025, with full production rollout expected by mid-2026.</p>"},{"location":"technology/tech-plan-2025/#technology-assessment","title":"Technology Assessment","text":"<p>This section provides an overview of our current technology stack (as of February 2025), our architecture framework, a critical assessment of GeoBlacklight, and recommendations for future tools.</p>"},{"location":"technology/tech-plan-2025/#current-technology-stack-overview","title":"Current Technology Stack Overview","text":""},{"location":"technology/tech-plan-2025/#1-software-applications","title":"1.

These tutorials cover a wide range of activities designed to meet the needs of instructors and students in a wide range of disciplines and levels of competency in geospatial data retrieval, use, and analysis.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Types of Geospatial Information, by Nicole Kong at Purdue University, introduces students to the most commonly used types of data in GIS. Using a range of visual and diagrammatic examples, it reviews the different data models that GIS professionals typically use to collect and share information, and which are discoverable through geodata portals.</p> </li> <li> <p>Find a Map, by Danny Dotson at Ohio State University, is designed to help students locate a map for a given topic and use it in a document. This tutorial reviews the steps required to locate a relevant map, using the BTAA Geoportal, how to download or copy the scanned map, how to insert the map into a given document, and provides an overview of basic fair use and copyright implications for using these maps.</p> </li> <li> <p>Find Geospatial Data, by Joshua Sadvari at Ohio State University, is intended to help geoportal users frame a search strategy and perform a search for geospatial data. The tutorial is divided into two activities designed to teach students how to access relevant geospatial data using the BTAA Geoportal based on their research or assignment objectives.</p> </li> <li> <p>Evaluate Geospatial Information, by Ryan Mattke at the University of Minnesota, is designed to help students evaluate geospatial data on the BTAA Geoportal for research and coursework. This tutorial reviews how to determine if metadata exist for a resource, how to review this metadata to understand the data\u2019s authority, quality, and relevance, and where to find citation information for resources found with the geoportal.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use GIS Web Services, by Jay Bowen at the University of Iowa, is meant to give GIS users a basic understanding of GIS web services, how to find them using the BTAA Geoportal, and how to use them in QGIS, ArcGIS Desktop, ArcGIS Online, and ArcGIS Pro. The tutorial also contains a link to a walkthrough demonstrating how to use GIS web services to create an interactive web map with Leaflet.</p> </li> <li> <p>Link Tabular Data to Geospatial Data, by Wenjie Wang at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, provides step-by-step instructions for downloading and visualizing spreadsheet data in ArcGIS Online by linking tabular data to geospatial data with a key index variable. More specifically, the tutorial gives an overview of how to locate and download a Wisconsin county boundaries shapefile and a data table of population for each county from the US Census Bureau. The tutorial then explains how to prepare the data, add these files to ArcGIS Online, and join the Census data to the county shapefile using the matching county names column in both files. Finally, the tutorial introduces how to symbolize the joined data using county population.</p> </li> <li> <p>Georeference, by Wenjie Wang at the University of Illinois, guides ArcMap users through the steps of georeferencing a scanned historic map of Hyde Park, Chicago. Georeferencing allows GIS users to employ scanned maps as thematically appropriate base maps for geospatial data. It is a particularly useful skill for historical work requiring GIS analysis and mapping. This tutorial explains how to select an appropriate projection, how to add and evaluate control points, how to run the rectification process, how to evaluate the results by making the scanned overlay semi-transparent, and how to publish your output as a tiled map service on ArcGIS Online. Publishing a georeferenced map in this manner allows for easy sharing over the web as well as convenient application in user-interactive web mapping.</p> </li> <li> <p>Digitize, by Nicole Kong at Purdue University, introduces how to use ArcGIS Pro to convert data in raster format, such as scanned maps or aerial imagery, into vector data, like points, lines, and polygons. Through the tutorial, students will get a brief overview of common digitization techniques, including preliminary evaluation of the raster data source, creating new feature classes by using different snapping methods and construction tools in ArcGIS, how to modify created features, and how to add attributes to digitized features. The tutorial also includes an exercise worksheet to reinforce the learned techniques.</p> </li> <li> <p>Create Elevation Surface Models Using LiDAR, by Milan Budhathoki at the University of Maryland, introduces LiDAR datasets and point cloud processing in ArcGIS Pro. In this tutorial, students will download a LiDAR point cloud from the BTAA Geoportal of the Washington Monument in Washington, DC. They will learn how to load this data in ArcGIS Pro and view it over a 2D map and obliquely in 3D. Following this, students will learn how to symbolize the points so that vegetation and buildings can be extracted from the dataset. Students will also learn how to filter all ground points to create a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) as well as to create a Digital Surface Model (DSM) from all the points.</p> </li> <li> <p>Build a GIS-Free Open-Source Zonal Stats Tool with Python in Jupyter Notebook, by Jay Bowen at the University of Iowa, teaches students with a basic knowledge of Python scripting how to make a free-standing zonal statistics tool that is not dependent upon desktop GIS software. This tool can be run on both MacOS and Windows and produces an input form to handle user inputs to determine the percent coverage of a given raster class range within a given polygon. For teachers and students who do not have time to download and install Anaconda-Navigator and Jupyter Notebook, there is a convenient step-by-step breakdown of the required code blocks that can be run in a Binder through GESIS Notebooks. This is particularly useful for those who want to gain a quick understanding of what the code does, but who do not have the capacity or desire to use storage space on their current computer. This tutorial is designed to initiate Python scripters to techniques for building their own GUI-driven GIS tools, which they can share with others who need simple user-friendly ways to analyze geospatial data.</p> </li> <li> <p>Story Maps, by Ryan Mattke at the University of Minnesota, introduces the process of creating a story map by using ArcGIS Online\u2019s StoryMaps interface. This tutorial covers many of the features within this tool that are not readily apparent as well as those that are not very intuitive. Some of these include how to add credits and content attribution, changing text formatting, adding buttons and separators, embedding media, and presenting media using immersive options. The tutorial also links learners to helpful resources for creating compelling story maps.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"tutorials/01_types-of-geospatial-information/","title":"Types of Geospatial Information","text":""},{"location":"tutorials/01_types-of-geospatial-information/#types-of-geospatial-information","title":"Types of Geospatial Information","text":"<p>Info</p> <p> Purpose: To introduce the most common types of data in GIS.</p> <p> Estimated time to complete: 30-40 minutes</p> <p> Prepared by: Nicole Kong, Associate Professor, GIS Specialist, Purdue University (kongn@purdue.edu). </p> <p> License: Except where otherwise noted, content in this tutorial is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/01_types-of-geospatial-information/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>Geographic Information Systems (GIS) can use several different types of data.

The numpy library allows for mathematical computations, while rasterio and rasterstats allow you easy manipulation and analysis of raster data.</p> <p>Also, you should notice how these lines of code interact with the code below to link the defined inputs to the GUI widgets. Notice that you have some control over the placement and appearance of these elements within the GUI. You can also edit the text.</p> <pre><code>    ##  GUI Widgets\n    ##  G-1. Shapefile Selection\n    ##  1-Label\n    label_1 = tk.Label(self, text=\"Select the shapefile for your area of interest\")\n    label_1.grid(row=0, column=0, columnspan=2, padx=5, pady=5, sticky=\"W\")\n\n    ##  1-Entry Box\n    var_1 = tk.StringVar()\n    entry_1 = tk.Entry(self, textvariable=var_1)\n    entry_1.grid(row=0, column=2, padx=5, pady=5, ipadx=100, sticky=\"W\")\n\n    ##  1-Button\n    button_1 = tk.Button(self, text=\"Browse\", command=BrowseFile_1)\n    button_1.grid(row=0, column=3, padx=5, pady=5, sticky=\"E\")\n</code></pre> <p>Let\u2019s look at what happens after you click \u201cOK\u201d. The code below defines the form inputs with some more memorable names. It also ensures that the raster class inputs are parsed as numeric values, rather than as strings.</p> <pre><code>    ##  Set input variables\n    input_zone_polygon = var_1.get()\n    input_value_raster = var_2.get()\n    low_class_str = var_3.get()\n    high_class_str = var_4.get()\n\n    ## Convert numeric strings to integers\n    low_class_int = int(low_class_str)\n    high_class_int = int(high_class_str)\n</code></pre> <p>A few lines below, you will see some code that defines the path to the raster file. Beneath this, is some code that isolates the file extension. Following this is a conditional test to isolate and define the driver, which we can use to create the new reclassified raster.</p> <pre><code>    ## Get the directory path of the input raster\n    ras_dir_path = os.path.dirname(input_value_raster)\n\n\n    ## Get the file extension of the raster file\n    file_ext = os.path.splitext(input_value_raster)[1]\n\n    if file_ext == '.tif':\n         drive = 'GTiff'\n    elif file_ext == '.img':\n         drive = 'HFA'\n\n    #Define the gdal driver with the drive variable from the conditional test\n    driver = gdal.GetDriverByName(drive)\n</code></pre> <p>The code below takes the input raster file and reassigns a binary classification based on the range the user defines in the dialog box. If the classes are higher or lower than the input range, these will be redefined as 0. If the classes match the desired range, they will be redefined as 1. Then, the code creates a new file called \u201craster2\u201d in the same directory as the input raster and sets the projection.</p> <pre><code>    file = gdal.Open(input_value_raster)\n    band = file.GetRasterBand(1)\n\n\n    # reclassification\n    classification_values = [0,low_class_int,high_class_int + 1]\n    classification_output_values = [0,1,0]\n\n    block_sizes = band.GetBlockSize()\n    x_block_size = block_sizes[0]\n    y_block_size = block_sizes[1]\n\n    xsize = band.XSize\n    ysize = band.YSize\n\n    max_value = band.GetMaximum()\n    min_value = band.GetMinimum()\n\n    if max_value == None or min_value == None:\n         stats = band.GetStatistics(0, 1)\n         max_value = stats[1]\n         min_value = stats[0]\n\n    # create new file\n    file2 = driver.Create( ras_dir_path + '/raster2' + file_ext, xsize , ysize , 1, gdal.GDT_Byte)\n\n    # spatial ref system\n    file2.SetGeoTransform(file.GetGeoTransform())\n    file2.SetProjection(file.GetProjection())\n</code></pre> <p>The following block of code assigns the newly defined classes to each pixel in the \u201craster2\u201d file by reading the input pixel values as an array and assigning new values based on a translation of classification breaks from the input \u201cclassification_values\u201d [0, 3, 7] to the output \u201cclassification_output_values\u201d [0, 1, 0]. Thus, any value less than 3 or greater than or equal to 7 is reclassified as 0, while anything greater than or equal to 3 and less than 7 is reclassified as 1.</p> <pre><code>print('Reassigning raster values...please wait...')\nfor i in range(0, ysize, y_block_size):\n     if i + y_block_size &lt; ysize:\n          rows = y_block_size\n     else:\n          rows = ysize - i\n     for j in range(0, xsize, x_block_size):\n          if j + x_block_size &lt; xsize:\n               cols = x_block_size\n          else:\n               cols = xsize - j\n\n          data = band.ReadAsArray(j, i, cols, rows)\n          r = zeros((rows, cols), np.uint8)\n\n          for k in range(len(classification_values) - 1):\n               if classification_values[k] &lt;= max_value and (classification_values[k + 1] &gt; min_value ):\n                    r = r + classification_output_values[k] * logical_and(data &gt;= classification_values[k], data &lt; classification_values[k + 1])\n          if classification_values[k + 1] &lt; max_value:\n               r = r + classification_output_values[k+1] * (data &gt;= classification_values[k + 1])\n\n          file2.GetRasterBand(1).WriteArray(r,j,i)\n\nfile2 = None \n</code></pre> <p>Next, the script identifies the projection of the input shapefile and reprojects the \u201craster2\u201d file to match the projection of the shapefile. The reprojected raster is then saved as \u201craster2_reproject\u201d in the same directory as the input raster. This process is important because both the polygon and raster need to be in matching projections for the computation of zonal statistics.</p> <pre><code># Get the EPSG code of the input shapefile\nshp_driver = ogr.GetDriverByName('ESRI Shapefile')\ndataset = shp_driver.Open(input_zone_polygon)\nlayer = dataset.GetLayer()\nspatialRef = layer.GetSpatialRef()\nshp_epsg = spatialRef.GetAttrValue(\"GEOGCS|AUTHORITY\", 1)\n\n# Reproject the raster\ninput_raster = gdal.Open(ras_dir_path + '/raster2' + file_ext)\noutput_raster = ras_dir_path + '/raster2_reproject' + file_ext\n\nwarp = gdal.Warp(output_raster,input_raster,dstSRS='EPSG:'+str(shp_epsg))\nwarp = None\n</code></pre> <p>The following lines perform the zonal stats analysis and display the percent coverage of the input polygon by the selected raster classes, along with some supporting statistics in a message window that appears on the user\u2019s screen after the analysis is complete.</p> <pre><code>zs = zonal_stats(input_zone_polygon,output_raster,stats=['min', 'max', 'mean', 'count', 'sum'])\n\n## Hide the tkinter root box\nroot = tk.Tk()\nroot.withdraw()\n\n## Define each zonal stat\nmin = [x['min'] for x in zs]\nmax = [x['max'] for x in zs]\nmean = [x['mean'] for x in zs]\ncount = [x['count'] for x in zs]\nsum = [x['sum'] for x in zs]\n\n## Build the messagebox content\nlines = [\"AOI covered by selected raster classes: \" + str(round(mean[0]*100,2))+\"%\", \"minimum: \" + str(min[0]), \"maximum: \" + str(max[0]), \"count: \" + str(count[0]), \"sum: \" + str(sum[0])]\n\n## Display the messagebox content in separate lines\ntk.messagebox.showinfo(\"Zonal Statistics Summary\", \"\\n\".join(lines))\n</code></pre> <p></p>Progress Notes<p></p> <p>After processing finishes, it will produce a text box providing information about how much of the polygon is covered by the selected range of classes.</p> <p></p>Zonal Statistics Summary<p></p> <p>The tool will also output a reprojected raster file (raster2_reproject) that isolates your selected raster class range.</p> <p>In the screenshot, you can see the results, isolating the tree canopy classes from the input raster.</p> <p></p>Iowa City Tree Canopy Raster<p></p>"},{"location":"tutorials/11_story-maps/","title":"Story Maps","text":"<p>Info</p> <p> Purpose: To provide a brief introduction to the capabilities of ArcGIS Story Maps.</p> <p> Estimated time to complete: variable</p> <p> Prepared by: Ryan Mattke, Map and Geospatial Information Librarian, University of Minnesota (matt0089@umn.edu). </p> <p> These slides and the accompanying activities are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/11_story-maps/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>Story Maps are an application within ArcGIS Online which allows you to integrate web maps with text, images, and other multimedia content.</p> <p>Story Maps allow you to:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Put your web maps in context</p> </li> <li> <p>Compare web maps and data sets</p> </li> <li> <p>Experiment!</p> </li> </ul> <p>Tip</p> <p>Click on any of the images in this tutorial to zoom in.</p> <p></p>Explore Stories<p></p>"},{"location":"tutorials/11_story-maps/#basics","title":"Basics","text":"<p>The first step is to log on to ArcGIS Online, go to your Content section, and click Create then Story Maps.</p> <p></p>Create Story Map<p></p> <p>Give your story a title and a subtitle and/or an introduction.</p> <p>Add cover image or video (upper right).</p> <p>Click the \u201c+\u201d symbol to add content to the story map.</p> <p></p>Adding Title and Content<p></p> <p>Be sure to take advantage of the options (at the bottom/end of the story map) to add credits and content attribution.</p> <p></p>Adding Credits<p></p> <p>Basic options for content:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Text \u2012 Options include heading, subheading, paragraph, , large paragraph, bulleted list, numbered list, and quote</p> </li> <li> <p>Button \u2012 To highlight a link with text</p> </li> <li> <p>Separator \u2012 Insert a horizontal line</p> </li> </ul> <p></p>Content Options<p></p> <p>Media options for content:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Map \u2012 Insert a web map or web app from ArcGIS Online</p> </li> <li> <p>Image \u2012 Upload or link to a jpg, png, gif, or svg file</p> </li> <li> <p>Image Gallery \u2012 Insert a gallery of up to 12 images</p> </li> <li> <p>Video \u2012 Upload or link to video content</p> </li> <li> <p>Audio \u2012 Upload or link to audio content</p> </li> <li> <p>Embed \u2012 Embed using iframe code or a web url;

We made strides in four key areas: Governance, Content Management, Asset Management, and Community Support.</p> <p>1. Governance Refresh: We updated our governance framework to reflect our shift to an ongoing program. This involved restructuring our committees and workgroups, developing a priority projects matrix, creating a new mission statement, and establishing goal-setting practices for each institutional partner. </p> <p>2. Content Management: We worked to improve the accessibility, discoverability, and persistence of our public content and documentation. We migrated our website to an open source platform, developed a public Metadata Harvesting Guide, and transferred our working documents to a shared Google Drive. </p> <p>3.

This matrix, inspired by the Minnesota Geospatial Advisory Council's workflows, helped us assess each project's likelihood of success. We then had team members vote on the importance of each project, creating a value score. By multiplying the likelihood of success by the value score, we categorized the projects into five high priority, six medium, and six low priority. Each committee has been assigned multiple projects, with some tasks designated for dedicated workgroups and others for individuals, including the Product Manager and a new hire. </p> <p></p> <p>The projects, along with their priority, owner, and status, are publicly available on our GitHub project board.</p>"},{"location":"updates/2024/august-2024-program-status-update/#program-activities","title":"Program Activities","text":""},{"location":"updates/2024/august-2024-program-status-update/#program-management","title":"Program Management","text":"<ul> <li>Program Team meeting featured Lightning Talk \"Ephemeral Geospatial Data: An Impending Digital Dark Age\" related to a forthcoming article.</li> <li>Conducting interviews for new Program and Outreach Coordinator position.</li> <li>New graduate student research assistant for metadata processing hired and began orientation.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"updates/2024/august-2024-program-status-update/#committees-and-workgroups","title":"Committees and Workgroups","text":"TECHnologyCommunity EngagementKnowledgeCoordinationGeodata Pilot WorkgroupFAST for Subject Terms Workgroup <ul> <li>Working on Geoportal footer links</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Published Important documents filter tool</li> <li>Updated website to announce that next BTAA GIS Conference will be in spring 2025   </li> </ul> <ul> <li>Held meeting with Community Engagement co-chairs to determine shared priorities</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Reviewed Geodata Pilot progress and scope</li> <li>Planned Program Team meeting topics</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Implemented a staging area using Box</li> <li>Added several test datasets to dev Geoportal</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Held kickoff meeting</li> <li>Analyzing the collection of map records for current adherence to a thesaurus.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"updates/2024/august-2024-program-status-update/#btaa-geoportal","title":"BTAA Geoportal","text":""},{"location":"updates/2024/august-2024-program-status-update/#analytics-statistics","title":"Analytics Statistics","text":"<p>August 2024 by the numbers</p> <ul> <li>Visitors: 8,280</li> <li>Visits: 8,824</li> <li>Downloads:     160</li> <li>Visits with download:  1.81%</li> <li>Outlinks: 988</li> <li>Visits with outlink: 11.20%</li> <li>Num. searches: 844</li> <li>Search keywords: 294</li> <li>Pageviews: 31,187</li> </ul> <p>Unique visitors by month </p> <p>More stats</p> <p>See full statistics on our Analytics Dashboard</p>"},{"location":"updates/2024/august-2024-program-status-update/#top-10-internal-searches","title":"Top 10 Internal Searches","text":"<ol> <li>ganborn</li> <li>geology</li> <li>lake superior</li> <li>university buildings</li> <li>europe map</li> <li>rainbow trout</li> <li>yemen</li> <li>striped bass</li> <li>greece</li> <li>york county, pennsylvania</li> </ol>"},{"location":"updates/2024/august-2024-program-status-update/#collections","title":"Collections","text":"<p> Total records as of September 1, 2024: 98,560</p> BTAA Geoportal Records from 2016 to  September 1, 2024"},{"location":"updates/2024/august-2024-program-status-update/#august-harvesting-activities","title":"August Harvesting Activities","text":"Title Records added Records retired Illinois Geospatial Data Clearinghouse 02a-01 Q3 2024 0 0 MN GeoCommons 05a-01 August 2024 1 0 PASDA 08a-01 Q3 2024 21 0 Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center Open Data 08f-01 Q3 2024 0 0 2024-08-06 Scan ArcGIS Hubs 183 59 2024-08-13 Scan ArcGIS Hubs 122 113 2024-08-20 Scan ArcGIS Hubs 98 36 2024-08-27 Scan ArcGIS Hubs 64 54 Humanitarian Data Exchange 99-1400 reharvest Q3 2024 463 0 Add Ohio parcels 1 0 Harvest Olmsted County, MN 05b-27109 10 0"},{"location":"updates/2024/august-2024-program-status-update/#development","title":"Development","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Development in August primarily revolved around the GeoBlacklight Summer Community Sprint, which focused on upgrading backend frameworks in anticipation of releasing a new major version (5.0).</p> </li> <li> <p>Excessive bot/AI web scraping traffic crashed our development Geoportal and UMN Web Development had to spend extra time to block the crawlers.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"updates/2024/august-2024-program-status-update/#next-steps","title":"Next Steps","text":"<p>Projects that are currently in progress or up next include:</p> <ul> <li>Create or update policies and disclaimers for the Geoportal</li> <li>Continue the Geodata Pilot</li> <li>Kickoff three new workgroups: implementing FAST subjects;

With the recent expansion of the Big Ten and the addition of new geospatial resources from the West Coast, we saw an opportunity to explore more modern and flexible ways to manage our collections. The result is a new Strategic Technology Plan: a roadmap for building a technology stack that is modular, resilient, and future-ready.  </p> <p>The most exciting feature of this new approach is a central metadata API. This feature will make it easier than ever to access and reuse our geospatial records. The API will support multiple discovery portals and access points, and we are even using it to develop a QGIS data discovery plugin!  </p> <p>As part of this shift, we are moving away from a large, all-in-one geoportal application toward a more flexible, modular framework built on open-source Python tools. This new structure makes it easier to update individual components and empowers us to think bigger: to prioritize data over tools, to collaborate better across institutions, and to build infrastructure that can adapt and grow over time.   </p> <p>Our 2025-26 roadmap encompasses four projects that will put this plan into action. Development is already underway, with full rollout planned by mid-2026.
