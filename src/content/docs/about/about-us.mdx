## Who we are

The Big Ten Geospatial Information Network (BTAA-GIN) is a collaboration of library-affiliated staff from Big Ten universities. We support geospatial research, foster connections among library professionals, and advance open-source tools and practices for discovering and preserving spatial data.

## Our approach

We focus on two themes: technical infrastructure and social infrastructure, both of which support geospatial research and a collaborative community.

### Technical infrastructure

Our technical infrastructure encompasses the platforms, metadata, and curation practicies that drive geospatial data discovery and stewardship.

**Program areas:**
- **Library geospatial infrastructures**: development of shared systems and open-source tools, including the [BTAA Geoportal](https://geo.btaa.org), a metadata API, and metadata tools.  
- **Digital curation & stewardship**: indexing open data and scanned maps, enhancing metadata, and collecting at-risk public data such as federal and municipal base layers.

### Social infrastructure

Our social infrastructure strengthens the network of geospatial library professionals.  

**Program areas:**
- **Professional development & community engagement**: annual conferences, graduate student support, and opportunities to exchange best practices across institutions.  
- **Research & knowledge**: transparent documentation, publications, and presentations that share lessons learned and contribute to the field of geospatial librarianship.
