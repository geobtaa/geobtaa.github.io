 The event centered on key questions: Who is this community for? How should it evolve? And how do we better support geospatial librarians and adjacent roles? The answer: broaden participation and build sustainability from the ground up.

**Key Highlights**

- launched a plan to rebrand the GeoBlacklight community as Geo4Lib, reflecting wider participation across libraries, archives, museums, academia, and industry
- affirmed Geo4LibCamp as a learning hub with hands-on workshops, lightning talks, and collaborative sessions
- explored scalable, low-maintenance alternatives to traditional geoportals, including modular APIs and static site deployments—with a focus on data archiving, system resilience, and long-term sustainability
- discussed AI-powered search, multilingual discovery, and LLM-generated metadata, alongside efforts to improve accessibility, onboarding, and usability for all user levels
- showcased <em>Mapping Prejudice</em>, highlighting how geospatial tools can uncover and address racial covenants in housing—advancing historical research and racial justice
- demonstrated <em>AllMaps</em>, a platform that connects historical maps with modern spatial data to support cultural heritage and archival research
- emphasized inclusive governance through rotating leadership, quarterly topical meetings, and cross-community collaboration
