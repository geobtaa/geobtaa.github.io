Projects with higher priorities will be tackled first, with lower priorities later in the year. Projects that are currently in progress or up next include:

* Compile a list of planned lightning talks for Program Team meetings
* Create or update policies and disclaimers for the Geoportal
* Continue the Geodata Pilot
* Kickoff three new workgroups: implementing FAST subjects;  Scalable Approaches; Service Models
