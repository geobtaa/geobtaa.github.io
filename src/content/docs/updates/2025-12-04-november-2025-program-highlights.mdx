## Building on a Decade of Accomplishments

BTAA-GIN held its first in-person retreat in seven years, bringing together colleagues from across the Big Ten for two days of reflection, collaboration, and strategic visioning. Together, we celebrated a decade of accomplishments, rolled up our sleeves to explore major initiatives underway, and worked through a structured process that kept members on their feet, sketching, debating, and refining ideas for BTAA-GIN’s future.

That energy translated into clear alignment around three broad themes, which the full network has since discussed and ranked to highlight areas of greatest impact and interest:

* Collections: Opportunities to strengthen and expand shared geospatial collections.
* Learning & Research: Ways to support geospatial engagement across educational levels.
* Community Leadership: Growing our presence in open-source geospatial communities and standards conversations.

In the weeks ahead, we will continue refining these themes and begin shaping the multi-year roadmap to guide FY26–FY28.
