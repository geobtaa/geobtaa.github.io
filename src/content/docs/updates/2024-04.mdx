## Monthly Highlight: New OpenIndexMaps for historical Mississippi River atlases

We recently added five OpenIndexMaps for [19th century atlases of the Mississippi River](https://geo.btaa.org/?f%5Bdct_creator_sm%5D%5B%5D=Owen+Connolly&f%5Bgbl_resourceType_sm%5D%5B%5D=OpenIndexMaps). Now, researchers can use an index map within the Geoportal to find and select atlas pages based upon location.

These OpenIndexMaps were created by our 2023-24 graduate research assistant, Owen Connolly. Owen delivered a presentation in April about this work to the Program Team, describing the creation process and demonstrating how the OpenIndexMap GeoJSON format can be ingested into ArcGIS StoryMaps to create interactive narratives. 

:::info
Owen is the [7th graduate research assistant](/team/people/#alumni) our program has supported. Several of these students have extended their position to fulfill requirements for the University of Minnesota's Master of GIS (MGIS) degree program, including internships, research credits, and delivering public presentations.

### Development

* Upgraded the Geoportal to GeoBlacklight version 4.4, which introduces support for COGs and PM Tiles
* Adjusted item page viewer height and scrollover function
* Added the AllMaps plug, which allows users to georeference and view previously georeferences IIIF maps.
* Began work to integrate S3 storage buckets into the GBL Admin Toolkit
