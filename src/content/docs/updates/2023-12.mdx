## Monthly Highlight: Our Program Website Has a New Home!

We migrated of our program website from Google Sites to a static site hosted on GitHub. This move brings several key benefits:

**Enhanced Accessibility & Stability**: Our content is now more accessible, presented in user-friendly HTML, authored in versatile Markdown, moving beyond the restrictions of Google Docs and Slides.

**Future-Proofing**: With Markdown and HTML's universal compatibility, we're poised for easy transitions to new templates or platforms. We have transitioned to a custom BTAA subdomain, stepping away from the UMN-branded Google Site address, which will ensure persistent links.

**Creative Control**: We now have greater flexibility in site design, leveraging custom CSS and Javascript, a feature limited in Google Sites.

### December Harvesting Activities

<Table
  src="src/tables/harvests_2023-12.csv"
    columns={[
    { key: "Task",   width: "50%", filter: "text",  wrap: "nowrap",  render: "markdown" },
    { key: "Records added",  width: "25%", filter: "text"},
    { key: "Records retired",   width: "25%", filter: "text" },
  ]}
/>


### Development

We focused on workflow improvements in December to enable the following tasks:

* Find and share a persistent link to items by their batch import or update ID
* Use a facet to select items by last accessioned date to identify records that need to be retired
