## Powering Computational Research

This month, BTAA-GIN is highlighting a new step-by-step tutorial that shows students and faculty how to apply deep learning models to geospatial data. The tutorial uses high-resolution aerial imagery from the BTAA Geoportal to teach machine learning workflows for spatial analysis.

What makes this possible? BTAA-GIN's work curating geospatial data and applying standardized workflows and metadata. This behind-the-scenes effort to ensure authoritative, well-described data means researchers can move directly from discovery to hands-on analysis using familiar GIS and data science tools to explore patterns, detect features, and ask new spatial questions.

As BTAA-GIN continues shaping its FY26–FY28 roadmap, examples like this show how shared collections continue to evolve alongside changing research and teaching practices across Big Ten universities.

#### Top Google searches leading to the Geoportal

<ChipList class="not-content">
  - Note: We're unable to publish our usual search analytics this month. We're investigating an issue where Google appears to have indexed one of our internal metadata pages as if it were a dataset, which has skewed our search traffic data. We're working to resolve this and will resume reporting accurate search trends once the issue is corrected.
