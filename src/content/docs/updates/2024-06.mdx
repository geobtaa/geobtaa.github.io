## Monthly Highlight: Governance Roadmap Completed


**This month, we completed our 2023-24 program roadmap, ["Revamping the BTAA GIN"](https://github.com/orgs/geobtaa/projects/10/views/6).**

The purpose of this roadmap was to guide our transition from a “Project” to an ongoing “Program,” with an increased focus on the social infrastructure of our organization. We made strides in four key areas: Governance, Content Management, Asset Management, and Community Support.

**- Governance Refresh**: We updated our governance framework to reflect our shift to an ongoing program. This involved restructuring our committees and workgroups, developing a priority projects matrix, creating a new mission statement, and establishing goal-setting practices for each institutional partner. 

**- Content Management**: We worked to improve the accessibility, discoverability, and persistence of our public content and documentation. We migrated our website to an open source platform, developed a public Metadata Harvesting Guide, and transferred our working documents to a shared Google Drive. 

**- Asset Management**: We began work to expand our asset management capabilities beyond discovery metadata records for the BTAA Geoportal. We issued a strategic plan for a BTAA geodata collection and enhanced our metadata management toolkit to support file ingest and storage.

**- Community Support**: We increased our support for the geospatial community by hosting the BTAA GIS Conference in 2023 and Geo4LibCamp in 2024, and by releasing our metadata management toolkit as a public GeoBlacklight plugin.

## Next Steps

For the 2024-2025 year, our new [Priority Projects board](https://github.com/orgs/geobtaa/projects/22/views/5) will function as our program guide.  Projects with higher priorities will be tackled first, with lower priorities later in the year. Projects that are currently in progress or up next include:

* Compile a list of planned lightning talks for Program Team meetings
* Create or update policies and disclaimers for the Geoportal
* Continue the Geodata Pilot
* Kickoff three new workgroups: implementing FAST subjects;  Scalable Approaches; Service Models
