We also performed extensive cleanup on several collections:  

* Updated links; added thumbnails for all [Michigan General Land Office Plats](https://geo.btaa.org/?f%5Bdct_isPartOf_sm%5D%5B%5D=06a-03)  
* Updated links; added IIIF views and thumbnails for all [Indiana Digital Collections](https://geo.btaa.org/?f%5Bgbl_resourceClass_sm%5D%5B%5D=Maps&f%5Bschema_provider_s%5D%5B%5D=Indiana+University)  
* Ingested metadata improvements for all scanned maps, including a new field for scale and FAST compliant subjects (as directed by the FAST for Subject Terms Workgroup)

### Web Development

**GeoBlacklight Admin Enhancements**  

* Launched the Data Dictionaries feature   
* Streamlined distribution imports with a background queue
   

**Dev Geoportal UX Redesign**  

* Improved item view pages with breadcrumb navigation, buttonless sidebar, always-visible citations/downloads, and a new ‚ÄúMore Like This‚Äù feature.  
* Created a guide documenting logos, colors, typography, and web components to ensure design consistency.  
* UI/UX improvements will continue in February, with further refinements to navigation, metadata display, and code snippets.
