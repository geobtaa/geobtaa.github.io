## BTAA-GIN Team Honored with Best Paper of the Year Award

The [Journal of Map & Geography Libraries](https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/wmgl20) has named two publications led by members of the BTAA Geospatial Information Network (BTAA-GIN) as Best Papers of the Year for 2024. This is a remarkable recognition of work emerging from BTAA-GIN's collaborative efforts to advance geospatial metadata standards and preservation practices.

<Card title="Ephemeral Geodata: An Impending Digital Dark Age">
*By Karen Majewicz, Ryan Mattke, and Melinda Kernik (University of Minnesota) and Jaime Martindale (University of Wisconsin-Madison).* This paper grew directly out of BTAA-GIN's collaborative work on geodata collection. It warns of the rapid disappearance of public geospatial data and calls on libraries to develop archiving strategies.

Journal of Map & Geography Libraries 20 (2): 88-113. https://doi.org/10.1080/15420353.2024.2389278

<Card title="OpenGeoMetadata Aardvark: A New Geospatial Metadata Application Profile">
*By Karen Majewicz (University of Minnesota), Rebecca Seifried (UMass Amherst), and Susan Powell (UC Berkeley).* This paper introduces a community-driven metadata profile for the discovery and reuse of geospatial resources. BTAA-GIN's metadata practices have influenced the schema.

</Card>

The awards committee praised both articles for demonstrating that effective metadata practices are essential to discovery, access, and long-term preservation, reflecting the evolving role of map librarians as curators and advocates for open, sustainable geospatial data infrastructures.
Congratulations to Karen, Ryan, Jaime, and Melinda on this honor and on representing BTAA-GIN's collective commitment to collaboration, openness, and stewardship.

### Collections

<p class="records-total">Total records as of November 1, 2025: **117,134**</p>

### Harvesting Activities

| Task | Records added | Records retired |
| :---- | -----: | -----: |
| 2025-09-30 Scan ArcGIS Hubs | 151 | 156 |
| 2025-10-314 Scan ArcGIS Hubs | 292 | 99 |
| Reharvest edu.wisc | 20 | 0 |
| Total | 463 | 255 |

<div class="gold-highlight">
<Card title = "Improved maintenance of stale records" >
We completed a project to review and update all the websites that previously could not be parsed programmatically and relied on static download files. During the review, we found over a dozen new ArcGIS Hub sites that are now fully harvestable and removed many broken or outdated links. This work also included improvements to the Provenance section of our metadata schema, making it easier to track the source and selection process for our records.

### Web Development

Our web development work has been focused on creating the BTAA Geospatial API and frontend.

- **API and Interface Deployment**: We deployed dev versions of the FastAPI and React applications to the OIT virtual machine using Kamal.
- **Improved Search Features**: The API now supports advanced search options like Boolean, field-specific, and spatial queries, plus new include/exclude faceting.
- **Bug Fixes and UI Updates:** Several minor interface bugs were resolved and facets now have the options to "exclude" values
- **Ongoing Work**: We are continuing to refine the frontend design, improve accessibility, and incorporate analytics.
