## Building a Sustainable Geodata Repository: BTAA-GIN Pilot Phase Complete

<TwoThirdsLayout>
  <div slot="left">
The BTAA-GIN Geodata Pilot Workgroup has successfully completed its current phase, establishing the technical and metadata infrastructure for a scalable geospatial repository. Over the past year (Q1 2024-Q1 2025), the workgroup focused on building a framework for data curation, refining metadata standards, and improving workflow automation.

### Key Accomplishments

* curated a pilot collection of 35 datasets on our development site to test our processes for gathering, describing, and sharing geospatial information
* added new metadata fields and entry guidelines to provide technical and administrative documentation for datasets
* created new methods for programmatically generating metadata and derivative files from collected datasets
* introduced new ways for users to evaluate datasets with visual previews and data dictionaries

### Next Step

The next phase, **Foundation (2025-26),** will feature our activites to:

* partner with data providers to develop a process for exchanging resources
* continue to enhance the BTAA Geoportal and backend management tools
* curate real-world data submissions to build our first official collections
* release a formal plan that documents our goals, workflows, and guidelines

## Program Activities

### Committees

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="TECHnology">
    - Reviewed new item page design.
    - Previewed the draft Strategic Technology Plan 2025-2026.
    - Reviewed candidates for potential data preservation/rescue and discussed the benefits of establishing a workgroup to update the collection development policy.

  <Card title="Community Engagement">
    - Shared a list of potential candidates for the geospatial data archiving pilot and government data rescue with the Tech Committee.
    - Completed two sprints to storyboard videos introducing GIN and providing Geoportal walkthroughs.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Knowledge">
    - Proposed discussing and brainstorming at-risk state datasets for the geospatial data archiving pilot at the next Program Team meeting as well as initiating a workgroup to align this with our mission and workflows.
    - Still seeking members for the [Geospatial Data Citation group](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JaHoM19eeUxMFeayJzVU6XP4PD9EX3Dob7Gfxwiekuo/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.q847yh9hguay).

  </Card>

  <Card title="Coordination">
    - Reviewed drafts of two new documents
    - Strategic Technology Plan 2025-2026
    - Geodata Collection Groundwork Phase Report
    - Onboarding of new members is ongoing. USC will participate in our monthly meetings until a final membership decision is made in July 2025.
