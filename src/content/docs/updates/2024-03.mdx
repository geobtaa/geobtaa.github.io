## Next Steps

The next steps on our [Program Roadmap 2023-2024](https://github.com/orgs/geobtaa/projects/10) include the following tasks:

- **Governance**:  Develop a priority projects matrix
- **Public documentation**: Teach the Team Members how to write in Markdown and contribute to our new website.

**Upcoming highlight**: In April, our graduate student research assistant will be delivering a public presentation about OpenIndexMaps featuring historical maps in the BTAA Geoportal.
