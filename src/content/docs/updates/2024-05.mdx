## Monthly Highlight: Allmaps Georeferencing Plugin

The BTAA Geoportal now features a plugin that integrates the Allmaps georeferencing platform for scanned maps hosted via IIIF. For maps that have already been georeferenced, users will find a second tab on the item page that displays the map over a basemap. For maps not yet georeferenced, users can use a widget in the sidebar to open the map in the Allmaps interface.

Users can find these items with a new facet, which will filter all of the maps hosted via IIIF with a count of how many have been georeferenced. In addition to enhancing user experience, this new feature can facilitate georeferencing sprints.
