## Introducing Our New Strategic Technology Plan

As the [BTAA Geoportal](https://geo.btaa.org/) continues to grow, so do the demands on our technology. With the recent expansion of the Big Ten and the addition of new geospatial resources from the West Coast, we saw an opportunity to pursue a more modern and flexible approach to managing our collections. The result is a Strategic Technology Plan for building a stack that is modular, resilient, and future-ready.

The centerpiece of this new approach is a central metadata API that will make it simpler to access and reuse our geospatial records. The API will support multiple discovery portals and access points, and it already powers a QGIS discovery plugin that is in active development.

We are moving away from a single, monolithic geoportal application toward a modular framework built on open-source Python tools. This structure lets us update individual components more easily and empowers us to prioritize data over tools, collaborate across institutions, and build infrastructure that adapts as our needs evolve.

Our [2025-26 roadmap](https://gin.btaa.org/technology/tech-plan-2025) outlines four projects that bring this plan to life. Development is underway with a full rollout targeted for mid-2026, and we look forward to sharing updates along the way.

## Web Development

- **Strengthened Geoportal stability and performance.** Implemented a bot mitigation solution using Cloudflare Turnstile and Samvera tools to stabilize uptime during disruptive traffic spikes.
- **Advanced OpenGeoMetadata API development.** Published a draft specification for a new geospatial API that supports BTAA and broader discovery efforts, laying groundwork for broader adoption.
- **Explored budget-friendly hosting solutions.** Tested Kamal deployment on a low-cost physical server as a promising option for hosting the GeoData API with minimal overhead.
