## 2025: A Year in Review

<p>In 2025, the Big Ten Academic Alliance Geospatial Information Network marked its tenth year with significant progress across all core programs. Our flagship service, the [BTAA Geoportal](http://geo.btaa.org), continued to grow, surpassing 114,000 records now available to researchers and the public. We also welcomed two new member institutions—Washington and Oregon—through a newly developed onboarding process.</p>
<p>This growth brought new demands on our technology. We published the [BTAA-GIN Technology Strategic Plan (2025–2026)](https://gin.btaa.org/library/tech-plan-2025/) and tested its direction through a prototype for a more flexible, future-ready Geoportal architecture. At the same time, the BTAA-GIN Geodata Collection Program reached a major milestone, transitioning from internal prototyping to real-world implementation. We established a clear [Urban Base Layers curation vision](https://gin.btaa.org/library/urban-curation-plan/), formed new data partnerships, published datasets from multiple cities, and refined our technical workflows.
</p>
<p>The fifth annual [Big Ten GIS Conference](https://gin.btaa.org/library/conference-report-2025/) set new records for both registration and attendance, reflecting the Big Ten's growing influence across geospatial research, tools, and techniques.
</p>
<p>The year concluded with BTAA-GIN's first in-person Strategic Planning Retreat in seven years. Colleagues came together to reflect on a decade of progress, align on shared priorities, and chart a [clear path toward 2028](https://gin.btaa.org/updates/2025-12-04-november-2025-program-highlights/)—building on the collaborative foundation that has sustained this work.
