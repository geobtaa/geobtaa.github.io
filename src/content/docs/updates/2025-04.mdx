## Big Ten GIS Conference 2025 Sees Strong Growth

- The fifth annual **Big Ten GIS Conference**, held virtually on April 11, 2025, marked a milestone for BTAA-GIN. With 664 registrants from 230+ institutions, the event tripled registration from the previous year and drew participants from academia, libraries, government, and research communities.
- Keynote speaker Dr. Emily Fairfax (UMN) delivered a widely praised talk on beavers and climate resilience. Three themed sessions and a lightning talk block showcased diverse work from students, professionals, and faculty.
- A twofold increase in presentation proposals led to a new formal review process, including anonymous evaluation and attention to balance across institutions and topics.
- This year, the conference moved from its traditional November date to April to avoid conflicts with GIS Day. The record-breaking turnout suggests April is far more accessible. **Save the date—April 2026**—and look for faculty outreach to begin in fall 2025.
- The success of the 2025 conference reflects BTAA-GIN’s growing visibility and influence in shaping shared geospatial infrastructure and collaboration across the Big Ten and beyond.

<Card>


#### FAST for Subject Terms Workgroup

* Drafted and shared with GIN a set of initial guidelines for using FAST subject headings, which offer easier maintenance than traditional Library of Congress terms.
* Identified the need for a shared template, consistent cleanup practices, and potential automation strategies.

#### Service Model Collaboration Workgroup

* Finalized and distributed a survey to GIN members to assess how GIS services are structured and delivered across BTAA institutions, with results to inform a forthcoming report on service models, strategic planning, and best practices.

#### Geospatial Data Citation Workgroup

* First meeting took place with new members. Planned development of a shared LibGuide on how to cite geospatial data including user testing.
