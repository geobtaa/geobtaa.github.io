This growth strengthens our collective ability to support geospatial research and education, laying the groundwork for new collaborations that will benefit all BTAA-GIN members.

* *Collection Expansion*: We look forward to collaborating with each institution to identify data and digital map collections that will enrich the Geoportal, which boasts over 100,000 resources.
* *Network Expansion*: With these new members, the BTAA-GIN now includes 17 institutions, spanning coast to coast. This expansion highlights our commitment to supporting geospatial research and education across the BTAA. As one of the largest collaborations of its kind in the field of GIS, our network continues to grow in size and value, amplifying its positive impact on geospatial data and research.
* *A History of Collaboration*: For over 9 years, the BTAA-GIN has exemplified academic collaboration, creating opportunities and driving innovation in geospatial services and tools across its member universities. The integration of these two renowned universities further boosts our shared influence and available resources.

### Workgroups

<Card>

#### Geodata Pilot Workgroup

	* Drafted final report for review.  
	* Plan is to complete this phase by the end of January, allowing us to begin the next phase in February.

#### FAST for Subject Terms Workgroup

	* MARC to GeoBTAA Metadata Crosswalk: Mapped GeoBTAA fields to MARC fields but needs to reverse the process to ensure all MARC fields are accounted for.  
	* Next Steps: Share the crosswalk in an accessible format and create a new sheet for maps metadata, including new fields for series names, spatial resolution, and tags.

#### Service Model Collaboration Workgroup

	* Drafted a new survey to explore tiered service models and compensation practices among BTAA-GIN members and beyond, focusing on service definitions, tier structures, and staffing. The plan is to share a revised draft with the larger program team in January.

### Development

**Ongoing Bot Traffic Issues**

Like many other rich-content websites, the Geoportal has lately been overwhelmed by AI bots, causing major slowdowns and outages. We have blocked traffic from certain regions, but the problem persists globally. A stronger security system, like a web application firewall, is a top priority for 2025.

**Improved Data Organization**

Our introduction of stored assets complicated our established workflow for adding links, such as downloads, supplemental metadata, and external website addresses. To improve our metadata management, we overhauled our GBL Admin database to migrate these links into a separate table. In addition to simplifying our descriptive metadata workflow, this separation allows us to use structured fields to describe the links.

**Work In-progress**

* Implementing data dictionaries.  
* Preparing for necessary server and framework updates in early 2025.
