## Monthly Highlight: New records from University of Chicago institute

<TwoThirdsLayout>
<div slot = "left">
We added one of our largest set of records this month: [8,605 records from the Center for Ancient Middle Eastern Landscapes, Institute for the Study of Ancient Cultures, University of Chicago](https://geo.btaa.org/catalog/12d-04) ("CAMEL").  This unique collection contains a mix of gereferenced maps and satellite imagery of the evolving Middle Eastern landscape.

This milestone represents several months of work. University of Chicago staff began meeting with the BTAA-GIN Product Manager in the summer of 2023 to prepare their metadata and workflows.  After several rounds of iterative testing, we were able to ingest the CAMEL records in January 202- The U. Chicago staff did a great job of programmatically producing metadata in the [GeoBTAA Aardvark metadata profile,](https://gin.btaa.org/metadata/geobtaa-metadata-application-profile/) and we are able to load their records without needing to perform any augmentation or edits.

### Workgroups

The Geodata Pilot Collection Workgroup held a kickoff meeting, where they discussed the concept of foundational layers and identified guidelines for selecting sample datasets.

### Program Management

* The new Northwestern University Team Member attended a program orientation and began attending Team Meetings. 
* Our graduate student Research Assistant and Product Manager attended a Research Spike with librarians from three University of California schools. They researched [OpenIndexMaps](https://openindexmaps.org) and identified areas where GeoBlacklight needs to be updated for OpenIndexMaps. We created a new [GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/geobtaa/projects/19) to track our related plans for the BTAA-GIN.
* The BTAA-GIN Executive Committee reviewed our Geodata Collection Strategic Plan, and approved our plans for next steps.

### Development

Development primarily focused on deferred maintenance and technology stack upgrade goals that improved performance and better prepares the Geoportal for future Blacklight and GeoBlacklight releases.

* Improved site performance by compressing CSS and JS assets
* upgraded Ruby to v3.3.0
* upgraded Ruby on Rails from v6.1 to v7.0
* upgraded the Mirador IIIF viewer

We also participated in the GeoBlacklight Community Sprint, which began at the end of January. Our goals are to modernize the applications JavaScript libraries, and overhaul the documentation site.
