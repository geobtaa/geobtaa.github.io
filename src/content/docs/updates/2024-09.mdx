## Monthly Highlight: Newly published article about ephemeral data


A new article titled "[](https://doi.org/10.1080/15420353.2024.2398542)," co-authored by four BTAA-GIN Team Members, was recently published in the *Journal of Map & Geography Libraries*. The authors explore a long-standing challenge for our program, framing the lack of public geodata archives as a "looming digital dark age." This analysis is based on our experiences managing the BTAA Geoportal and [GeoData@Wisconsin](https://geodata.wisc.edu), as well as our roles as map librarians. This article not only highlights a widespread issue but also provides a compelling rationale for our new initiative, the BTAA-GIN Geodata Collection, which aims to address gaps in the availability and accessibility of geospatial resources.
