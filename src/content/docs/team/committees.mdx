Our 4 program committees work independently and collaborate on overlapping issues.

<div slot = "left">
### Community Engagement Committee

*Connecting with the public*

The mission of the Community Engagement Committee is to promote and enhance the visibility and utilization of the BTAA Geoportal, as well as public and shared geospatial data and technology, among GIN (Geospatial Information Network) members and Geoportal users. Our committee is committed to fostering inclusivity and promoting diversity and equity in geospatial resources. We achieve this by expanding the community of Geoportal users through the inclusion and promotion of new and existing resources.

### Knowledge Committee

*Enhancing our professional community*

The Knowledge Committee will identify and implement strategies for knowledge sharing internally among BTAA Geospatial Information Network members and externally with the broader map and geospatial librarian community. We will do this by establishing research agendas, coordinating research, and reporting/publishing on topics relevant to the geospatial librarian field and the BTAA-GIN.
