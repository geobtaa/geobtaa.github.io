## Summary

Established in 2020, the BTAA GIS Conference is a virtual event organized by geospatial information users and educators in Big Ten institutions to present their work, exchange information, and develop potential collaborations.

The BTAA-GIN Conference Planning Group met 7 times between July and November. We also had three tech rehearsals with the BTAA IT team. The planning group divided up roles and responsibilities by identifying task leads, including communicating with the keynote speaker, managing the website pages, issuing proposals, putting the conference agenda together, building the map gallery, coordinating Zoom, and editing the videos.

We used a planning spreadsheet to keep track of our work: [2023 BTAA GIS Conference Planning](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14EqhfGZwYZ2daYfg_tCY9DA9weGKsHfhQ1fRVlkwWIw/edit?usp=sharing)

## Key Takeaways (2023)

### Plusses

➕ Reach of the conference continues beyond the day-of event via YouTube videos, viewed increasingly over time.

➕ The BTAA IT partners were wonderful and went above and beyond to help us: three tech rehearsals and staying online the whole time to manage the Zoom.

➕ The technical aspect of the conference ran very smoothly. Our new system of having a facilitator and slide-runner made transitions easier and faster.

➕ Served as an augmentation to local GIS Days.

➕ The new [Map Gallery](https://gin.btaa.org/Map-Gallery-Update/) is easy to use and links to all years.

➕ The videos were processed very quickly, because of a new role for a dedicated video person.

### Minuses

➖ We needed at least three people for each session and did not have enough volunteers to fill each slot.

➖ The day of the event was somewhat tiring for the facilitators and moderators.

➖ We did not feel empowered to create things like branded swag or gifts.

### Planned changes for next year

Δ Considering moving conference to spring: there are fewer conflicting events and this would give us a longer lead-up time to promote and coordinate

Δ Simplify communications with more batch emails and possibly implementing tools like a Contact Relations Database and/or an email marketing platform.

Δ Present more information and highlights about the BTAA-GIN and the Geoportal in the welcoming remarks.
