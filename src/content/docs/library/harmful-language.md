We at the BTAA Geospatial Information Network recognize that historical collections may contain harmful language and geographic place names considered representative at the time of creation. We are committed to the remediation of such terms in the metadata of our collections to eliminate oppression, bias, and marginalization. 

We are seeking to balance making our items discoverable for researchers with eliminating known instances of harmful language in our metadata. To assist with searching for historical items, which are often discovered through bibliographies and citations, titles are transcribed as shown on the item.

If you encounter harmful language in our metadata, please consider filling out our [feedback form](https://geo.btaa.org/feedback).
