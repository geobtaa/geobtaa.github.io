## Purpose

The Urban Base Layers project is a curated collection of foundational geospatial datasets that document the basic structure and function of major metro areas across the Big Ten region. These datasets are essential for research in housing, land use, urban planning, environmental change, and civic infrastructure. Our goal is to ensure these widely used but inconsistently preserved datasets are accessible, well-documented, and available for long-term scholarly use. 

## The Layers

<TwoThirdsRLayout>

<div slot="left">
We collect six foundational geospatial layers:

<div class="compact-list">
1. Address points  
2. Building footprints  
3. City boundaries  
4. Parks  
5. Streets  
6. Zoning districts
</div>
</div>

</TwoThirdsRLayout>

## Time Periods

The collection is made up of temporal snapshots that can support research long into the future.

* Primary target year: 2025 (most current version available)
* Secondary targets: Earlier versions in approximately five-year increments (2020, 2015, 2010, 2005, 2000)
* Other years: Included opportunistically, but not prioritized


## The Cities

<TwoThirdsRLayout>
<div slot="left">
Our initial scope includes the largest cities in each state of the BTAA region:
<div class="compact-list">
1. Baltimore  
2. Chicago  
3. Columbus  
4. Des Moines  
5. Detroit  
6. Indianapolis  
7. Milwaukee  
8. Minneapolis  
9. Newark  
10. Omaha  
11. Philadelphia  
12. Portland  
13. Seattle
</div>

## Anticipated Outcomes

* A collection of foundational layers that support current and future research in urban studies and environmental change  
* A complement to the legacy of historical fire insurance maps, which are the most accessed type of resource in our geoportal by a wide margin
* A reusable framework for collecting both retrospective and future snapshots
* A partial remediation of the temporal gaps in available geodata from the early 21st century

## Method of Aquisition

<Steps>
1. Work with city GIS staff to obtain original-format datasets and metadata  
2. Document the datasets using the OpenGeoMetadata profile
3. Create web derivatives for previews (thumbnails and PM Tiles)
4. Upload datasets to storage buckets
5. Index in the BTAA Geoportal
