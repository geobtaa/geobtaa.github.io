## Purpose

This initiative aims to collect foundational geospatial datasets that document the basic structure and function of major cities in the Big Ten Academic Alliance (BTAA) region. The collection will be made up of temporal snapshots that can support research long into the future.


## The Layers

<TwoThirdsRLayout>

<div slot="left">
We will collect six foundational geospatial layers:

1. Address points  
2. Building footprints  
3. City boundaries  
4. Parks  
5. Streets  
6. Zoning districts

</div>

</TwoThirdsRLayout>

## Time Periods

* Primary target: 2025 datasets (to be collected and processed by end of 2025\)  
* Secondary targets: Earlier versions in five-year increments (2020, 2015, 2010, 2005, 2000\)  
* Other years: Included opportunistically, but not prioritized


## The Cities

<TwoThirdsRLayout>
<div slot="left">
Our initial scope includes the largest cities in each state of the BTAA region:
<div class="compact-list">
1. Baltimore  
2. Chicago  
3. Columbus  
4. Des Moines  
5. Detroit  
6. Indianapolis  
7. Milwaukee  
8. Minneapolis  
9. Newark  
10. Omaha  
11. Philadelphia  
12. Portland  
13. Seattle
</div>

## Anticipated Outcomes

* A collection of foundational layers that support current and future research in urban studies and environmental change  
* A complement to the legacy of historical fire insurance maps, which are the most accessed type of resource in our geoportal by a wide margin
* A reusable framework for collecting both retrospective (e.g., 2020, 2015) and future (e.g., 2030) snapshots
* A partial remediation of the temporal gaps in available geodata from the early 21st century

## Method of Aquisition

Most of these datasets are publicly available through municipal ArcGIS Hubs. However, our preferred approach is to obtain data directly from city data providers whenever possible.

### Challenges with ArcGIS Hub downloads

* Timeouts or failed downloads for large datasets  
* Exported files often lack embedded metadata  
* Shapefile field limitations and reprojection may lead to data loss
  
### Preferred approach

<Steps>
1. Work with city GIS staff to obtain original-format datasets and metadata  
2. Document the datasets using the OpenGeoMetadata profile
3. Create web derivatives for previews (thumbnails and PM Tiles)
4. Upload datasets to storage buckets
5. Index in the BTAA Geoportal
