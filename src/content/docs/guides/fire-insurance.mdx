## What are Fire Insurance Maps?

Fire insurance maps are detailed city plans originally created to evaluate fire risk. They depict building footprints, construction materials, and property uses, along with street layouts and property lines. These maps offer a unique, granular snapshot of urban neighborhoods as they existed in the 19th and 20th centuries.

The Sanborn Map Company produced the majority of fire insurance maps, but other publisher names include Perris, Hexamer, Whipple, Baist, Bromley, or Hopkins.

## Finding Fire Insurance Maps

Because they are a popular research resource, fire insurance maps have been scanned and made available in a variety of ways, some under commercial license provided by a library purchase or subscription. There is no single resource that has all the maps in one location.

This guide provides a suggested path for finding a Sanborn Map.

### 1. Start with the BTAA Geoportal Search

1. Begin your search with the [BTAA Geoportal](https://geo.btaa.org).
1. In the main search box, enter the name of your town or city.
1. On the results page, use the filters on the left to select **"Fire insurance maps"** under the **Resource Type** heading.

:::tip[Search Tips]
* **Can't find a small town?** Try searching for a larger, nearby city. Suburbs and smaller communities were often included in the map volumes of a major city. For example, East Lansing, MI, is found within the Lansing map set.
* **Large cities** are often mapped across many volumes. Each volume will have an index map on its first page showing which sheets cover which areas.
:::


### 2. Browse BTAA Collections by State

If a general search doesn't yield results, you can browse specific collections. These collections, contributed by BTAA member libraries and partners, are organized by the state they cover.

#### Open Access Collections

These maps are freely available to everyone.

## How to Read Fire Insurance Maps

Each city coverage begins with a graphic index to guide the user to the correct page with each page only covering a few blocks. The original paper maps used color to indicate building materials such as yellow for wood construction and pink for brick. Some newer maps have “paste on” updates or corrections applied to a base map. Note the correction record on the index key page for dates. While Sanborn maps do not show property owner names, they can show business names. For more information, see the Library of Congress’ Introduction to the Sanborn Collection.
