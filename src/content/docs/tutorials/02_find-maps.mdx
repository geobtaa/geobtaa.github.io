It is designed to not go beyond that level - the maps in this case are being used in a very basic and illustrative manner. No GIS is required. A sample assignment is also shared.

### Placing images in a document¶

Place in document (Word, PowerPoint, Google Document, Google Slides, etc.) like you would any other image.
If you right clicked and copied, then right click and paste.
If you saved, insert and find where you placed the file, then choose the file.

### Resizing images¶

It will very likely need to be resized.
Most tools will allow you to do this manually by clicking on the image and then choosing one of the corners to resize.
You can also crop, if desired.

### Captioning and citing images¶

Be sure to caption the image to indicate what it is. Also, you will want to cite the image, indicating whetee you got it from.
The Geoportal provides a cite option for items, but you may need to adapt to the citation style required by your instructor.

## Copyright and fair use

:::caution
But wait, you can't just use every image freely and in any way you want….you need to determine if an image is copyrighted.
:::

Here is a 5¢ tour of determining whether you can use an image. However, you should ask your instructor or librarian questions to be sure your use is okay.

Even if the ORIGINAL is older (such as our 1750 map example), the scan of the item may be covered by copyright. Assume all images online are copyrighted unless:

* It is from a FEDERAL US Government source (items from state and local government sources may be copyrighted)
* There is another statement of rights, such as a Creative Commons license.

**So, can you use it?**

Generally, if you are using it just in a class presentation or in an assignment submitted to your instructor, your use of the map would likely be considered fair use and acceptable.
If your content is posted online for wider distribution, such as in a journal article or electronic thesis, this would NOT be considered fair use and you likely cannot use a copyrighted image without seeking permission from whoever owns the image.
