## Scope

Since 2015, we have collected, normalized, and enhanced geospatial metadata from hundreds of sources, including open data from local, state, and federal governments, nonprofits, research institutes, and universities. We also provide access to scanned maps from all Big Ten libraries. The collection now includes more than 100,000 geospatial resources.

In 2025, BTAA-GIN expanded its scope from metadata aggregation to data stewardship: we now collect, preserve, and provide access to open geospatial data. This initiative helps close gaps in recent historical coverage and advances the mission of libraries to steward the history of our geospatial landscape.

## Urban Base Layers

Our first geodata curation collection is the Urban Base Layers project. This initiative aims to collect foundational geospatial datasets that document the basic structure and function of major cities in the Big Ten Academic Alliance (BTAA) region.
