# Program History

Our collaborative program was first proposed in 2012 when three map librarians issued a white paper, A Collaborative Vision for Spatial Scholarship across the CIC.(1) This paper identified geospatial data as a long-term, interdisciplinary need that would necessitate increasingly complex infrastructures to manage. The authors concluded that these infrastructures would likely be prohibitively expensive for each CIC library to maintain individually, and they proposed collaborative solutions for the long-term management of geospatial resources.

The BTAA Geospatial Data Project officially began in 2015 with 9 member institutions and grew to incorporate all BTAA libraries over time. Since that time, we built the BTAA Geoportal, started an annual GIS conference, and strengthened the network of geospatial library workers. In 2023, we evolved into a new structure, now called the BTAA Geospatial Information Network.
