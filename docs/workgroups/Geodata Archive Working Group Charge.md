| The Geodata Archive Working Group will explore options for creating a BTAA Geodata Archive. The BTAA Geodata Archive would follow a systematic process for archiving public geospatial data created across the BTAA geographic region. Options could include any or all of the following: contract out for building a software solution and then hosting within the BTAA; contract out for building a software solution and hosting; building a software solution and hosting within the BTAA. Public geospatial data is: created or published by state, regional, or local government entity or academic institution; free and open; a recognized geospatial file format (e.g. shapefile) or aerial image file (e.g. jpg, tiff).  Archiving is a system that includes any or all of the following: file storage; archiving strategies (identifiers, replication, verification); preservation (validation and migration); curation (valuation and description). The BTAA Geodata Archive would benefit the community by ensuring long term access to a wealth of valuable geospatial data so that it can be preserved and available for the future, recognizing that data becomes more valuable over time for use as the basis of historical research, time series analyses, and longitudinal studies.  |
