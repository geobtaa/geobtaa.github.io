## STRATEGIC ROADMAP

*Follow our progress*

- [x] Done
- [ ] {++In progress++}
- [ ] Not started

### 1. Foundations & Pilot Storage (2024 Q1-Q2)

#### Initiate Working Group and Planning

- [x] Establish and run the Geodata Collection Pilot Working Group.

- [x] Research existing geodata archiving practices across the BTAA region

- [x] Create an initial set of test datasets.

#### Recruitment and Staffing

- [x] Assess current team capabilities and identify gaps in skill or resources.

- [x] Draft job description Program and Outreach Coordinator

- [x] Advertise the position


#### Technical Setup

- [x] Establish Amazon cloud storage (S3) accounts: Set up and configure Amazon S3 buckets for data storage.

- [x] Integrate or develop tools within GBL Admin for ingesting and managing datasets.

- [x] Test adding sample datasets to Amazon S3: Conduct tests to ensure data can be stored, accessed, and managed effectively in the cloud environment.

#### Documentation and Process

- [x] Obtain official approval of the BTAA-GIN Geodata Collection Strategic Plan.


### 2. Develop Curation Plan and Explore Technology Enhancements (2024 Q3-Q4)

#### Pilot Workgroup

- [x] Determine staging environment for sharing datasets

- [x] Select a broader range of sample data.

- [x] Add sample data to staging area.

- [ ] {++Determine minimum metadata requirements.++}

- [ ] {++Analyze and test new GBL Admin features for data management.++}

- [ ] Integrate new sample data into the pilot

- [ ] Sunset the pilot workgroup.


#### Technology Enhancement and Integration

- [x] Set up staging area (Box)

- [ ] Implement GBL Admin features identifed as needed for data management. (i.e. fixity checks, administrative metadata views)

- [ ] Begin planning for enhancing GBL Admin to feature batch uploads and processing.

- [ ] Redesign Geoportal Dev branch interface to improve discovery and access for the Geodata Collection.


#### Curation Plan Development

- [ ] {++Identify and the types of geospatial data to be included in the collection.++}

- [ ] Define curation criteria, including data selection, acquisition, and quality control.

#### Recruitment and Staffing

- [ ] {++Continue process for interviewing for new position++}}
- [ ] Finalize the hiring process and onboard new hire

#### Communication Plan Development

- [ ] Identify key stakeholders.

- [ ] Develop communication strategies (frequency, channels, and content).

- [ ] Prepare communication templates and materials.

#### Documentation and Process

- [ ] {++Document the setup and configuration processes for S3 accounts and asset management tools.++}

- [ ] Document pilot testing procedures and decisions.

- [ ] Document the curation plan: Create detailed documentation outlining the curation strategy, procedures, and responsibilities.


### 3. Begin Active Curation and Implement Enhancements (2025 Q1-Q2)

#### Active Curation Process

- [ ] Establish curation cycles.

- [ ] Implement data quality checks and validation processes.

#### Technology Deployment and Enhancement

- [ ] Publish Geoportal design enhancements to the production site: Transition the updated Geoportal interface from the development branch to the live environment, ensuring all new features are fully operational.

- [ ] Conduct final testing of the enhanced GBL Admin: Ensure that the new batch asset management functionalities are working as intended and integrate feedback from the pilot phase.

#### Monitoring and Evaluation

- [ ] Set up monitoring tools for the new systems: Implement tools to continuously monitor the performance and usage of the Geoportal and data repository, ensuring they meet user needs and technical requirements.

- [ ] Review initial active curation outcomes: Evaluate the effectiveness of the curation process, identifying areas for improvement or adjustment.

### 4. Documentation & Outreach (2025 Q3-Q4)

#### Outreach and Communication

- [ ] Develop and execute an outreach plan: Create a detailed plan for engaging with the community, including conferences, webinars, and workshops to showcase the project.

- [ ] Prepare and publish outreach materials: Design and distribute materials to highlight the project's features and benefits.

#### Assessment and Feedback

- [ ] Conduct program evaluation: Assess the project's impact on users and stakeholders, evaluating how well the curation plan and new systems are meeting the established goals.

- [ ] Gather and analyze user feedback: Use surveys, interviews, and usage data to understand user experiences, satisfaction, and areas for improvement.

#### Continuous Improvement

- [ ] Establish mechanisms for regularly updating the project based on stakeholder feedback and evolving requirements.

- [ ] Plan for next phases of project expansion.
