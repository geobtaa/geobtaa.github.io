- [x] Done
- [ ] {++In progress++}
- [ ] Not started

## 1. Set up storage & pilot workgroup (2024 Q1-Q2)

### Pilot Workgroup

- [x] Establish the Geodata Collection Pilot Working Group.
- [x] Research existing geodata archiving practices across the BTAA region.
- [x] Create an initial set of test datasets.

### Technology

- [x] Establish Amazon cloud storage (S3) accounts for data storage.
- [x] Develop techniques within GBL Admin for basic ingest of datasets.
- [x] Test adding sample datasets to Amazon S3.

### Recruitment and staffing

- [x] Assess current team capabilities and identify gaps in skill or resources.
- [x] Draft job description Program and Outreach Coordinator.
- [x] Advertise the position.

### Documentation

- [x] Obtain official approval of the BTAA-GIN Geodata Collection Strategic Plan.
- [x] Create and publish a Geodata Collection Implementation Plan that expands on the Strategic Plan.


## 2. Develop Curation Plan and explore technology enhancements (2024 Q3-Q4)

### Pilot Workgroup

- [x] Determine staging environment for sharing datasets
- [x] Select a broader range of sample data.
- [x] Add sample data to staging area.
- [ ] {++Determine minimum metadata requirements.++}
- [ ] {++Analyze and test new GBL Admin features for data management.++}
- [ ] Integrate new sample data into the pilot.
- [ ] Determine batch upload needs.
- [ ] Sunset the pilot workgroup.


### Technology

- [x] Set up staging area (Box).
- [ ] Implement new GBL Admin features as needed for data management. (i.e. fixity checks, administrative metadata views).
- [ ] Begin planning for how to incoportate batch ingest functionality in GBL Admin.
- [ ] Redesign the Geoportal interface to improve discovery and access for the Geodata Collection on the development branch.

### Recruitment and staffing

- [ ] {++Continue process for interviewing for new position++}
- [ ] Finalize the hiring process and onboard new hire

### Curation Plan development

- [ ] {++Identify the themes of geospatial data to be included in the collection.++}
- [ ] Define curation criteria, including data selection, acquisition, and quality control.
- [ ] Update the GeoBTAA Metadata Application Profile as needed.

### Documentation

- [ ] {++Document the setup and configuration processes for S3 accounts and asset management tools.++}
- [ ] Document pilot testing procedures and decisions.
- [ ] Document and publish the curation plan.


## 3. Begin active curation and communication (2025 Q1-Q2)

### Communication

- [ ] Identify key stakeholders.
- [ ] Develop communication strategies (frequency, channels, and content).
- [ ] Prepare communication templates and materials.

### Technology

- [ ] Transition the updated Geoportal interface from the development branch to the live environment.
- [ ] Implement batch ingest functionality in GBL Admin.

### Active curation process

- [ ] Establish curation cycles.
- [ ] Implement data quality checks and validation processes.
- [ ] Ingest and publish assets as identified in Communication and Curation Plans.


## 4. Outreach and evaluation (2025 Q3-Q4)

### Outreach

- [ ] Create an outreach schedule for engaging with the community, including presentations at conferences.
- [ ] Conduct educational sessions on data curation as webinars or workshops.
- [ ] Design and distribute outreach materials to highlight the project's features and benefits.

### Assessment and Feedback

- [ ] Assess the project's impact on users and stakeholders.
- [ ] Evaluate how well the curation plan functions.

### Monitoring and Evaluation

- [ ] Set up monitoring tools for the new systems.
- [ ] Evaluate the effectiveness of the curation process, identifying areas for improvement or adjustment.

### Continuous Improvement

- [ ] Establish mechanisms for regularly updating the project based on stakeholder feedback and evolving requirements.
- [ ] Plan for next phases of project expansion.
