# Continuation Proposal 2019

Proposal for Funding for Years 5 & 6 (July 2019 - June 2021)

## Proposal

Continuing to build on the successes of the Big Ten Academic Alliance Geospatial Data Project in its first four years, we propose an investment of $15,000 per institution for each of the next two years (with twelve participating institutions, this would total $180,000 per year). The next two years will solidify operations of an established and sustainable production service, continue the growth of the collection of geospatial metadata records, and complete exploration of expanded strategic directions. This expansion may require an increase in funding beyond the requested two-year investment, which would be presented in a revised Year 6 budget proposal.

## Project Context

The Big Ten Academic Alliance Geoportal is one of a handful of geoportals maintained by academic institutions across the United States. Others include [OpenGeoportal](http://data.opengeoportal.org/), [Earthworks](https://earthworks.stanford.edu/), and [NYU Spatial Data Repository](https://geo.nyu.edu/). As of October 2018, the BTAA project has contributed nearly 9,000 metadata records to [OpenGeoMetadata](https://github.com/OpenGeoMetadata), a large-scale aggregation of geospatial metadata from many different institutions. By participating in the broader geospatial metadata ecosystem, these records can now be utilized by other geoportals to allow discovery and access for geospatial data resources from nine states within the Big Ten Academic Alliance. 

## Assessment of project to date and emerging areas of focus 

Geospatial data are notoriously hard to find using standard web search engines. The main barrier is that the user needs to know who generates the type of data they are looking for and seek out that entity’s website to find datasets. With the Geoportal, a user does not need to know who created the data in order to find it. Users can focus on searching by What, When, and Where. They do not have to worry about Who or Why. The Geoportal has already made significant progress in this regard, having aggregated metadata from nearly 80 different data portals and map collections and augmented it by assigning subjects, dates, place names, and bounding box coordinates to each record. 

There are three concerns in the project as currently scoped that present opportunities for increased focus for the next two years:

### 1. The Geoportal is not yet a well-known resource, because it has not been effectively promoted.

Addressing this issue would not necessitate an expansion in project scope. The Task Force members plan to focus on outreach and promotion by creating and implementing a detailed Communications Plan, and by working directly with communications professionals and subject liaisons at participating BTAA institutions. They will also gather focused input from faculty, researchers, students, and other user communities.

### 2. Public geospatial data are alarmingly unstable. 

Government data providers regularly migrate, update, delete, and re-publish data. These practices result in broken access links in the Geoportal. One solution to this problem to be explored is archiving and preserving the data in a spatial data repository to ensure stable and persistent access. Addressing this issue would necessitate an expansion in project scope (see below).

### 3. Expected changes in the technology development and support personnel for the BTAA Geoportal. 

The University of Minnesota expects a significant reduction in the availability of the Geoportal's lead (but part-time) developer in early 2019. This has prompted opportunity to take stock of the project's technology support needs moving into the next few years. Maintaining high technical reliability and performance alongside accelerated feature and service development are priorities. To do so, Minnesota plans to combine its current in-kind funding commitment for a part-time developer (at the 0.35FTE to 0.50FTE level) with the project's accrual of budgeted technology funds for contracted software development to appoint a 0.75FTE to 1.0FTE GeoBlacklight developer over the next two years (see Project Budget section for detailed numbers). This will increase the technology support capacities of the project without increasing costs to participating institutions.

## Continuing exploration of a strategic expansion in scope

### 1. Archiving and preservation.

Although the project has compiled information on the spatial data archiving and preservation capabilities at participating universities, it is not clear where the priority rests for developing such a capability BTAA-wide, and/or for creating it for the institutions that currently lack it. To determine this, additional conversations are needed, including with libraries administrations. This will also provide an opportunity to interface and collaborate with local, county, regional, and state government agencies who produce the geospatial data. Creating formal archiving agreements with government data providers would enhance reliability, but add complexity. 

### 2. Web services.

The project’s stakeholders have expressed enthusiasm for developing a collaborative solution to provide online geospatial web services. These would allow users to access and visualize geospatial data in a web browser or mapping application without the need for specialized software. 

### 3. Licensed data. 

Many participating institutions hold licensed geospatial data that they wish to submit to the geoportal. Incorporating these types of resources would present challenges in terms of enabling multiple institutional authentication protocols that will require specialized technical research. One possibility would be the Shared Big Data Gateway project (CADRE).

## Progress towards Years 3 & 4 project goals

Progress on goals to guide new development of program areas, in addition to continued support and refinement of established operations (see Appendices C & D for additional details): 

### 1. Sustainability, Maturation, and Strategic Planning

* reorganized governance to appoint a UMN Product Owner, to create more structured topical committees, and to charge short term working groups 
* created a [Technology Stack Matrix](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q5ZMF4k1s3rfcl3A2qY6hiPBCd-IstdAf_huQwtl9hY/edit?usp=sharing) identifying the existing technology infrastructure at each institution for data archiving, preservation, and discovery services
* convened a Strategic Leadership Group 
* Project Lead convened a series of meetings involving geoportal representatives from NYU, Princeton, and Stanford

    
### 2. Collection Development

* drafted a [Collection Development Policy](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1NBDEAZA88LET4g2ZsfrmfTwIUoVJHepv) and [Collections Strategic Work Plan](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1n9rg7x7jeEO3TkppJOIMogO6S8M9SWWq) 
* conducted an updated inventory of open data portals/websites across the Big Ten 
* grew the collection to over 15,000 records (see Appendix A)


### 3. Geospatial community outreach and education

* presented geospatial metadata workshops at local and national conferences, including collaboration with librarians from Stanford and NYU
* 4 published articles and 16 presentations or posters at national or international conferences (see Appendix B)
