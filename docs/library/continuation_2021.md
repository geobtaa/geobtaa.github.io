# Continuation Proposal 2021

Proposal for Funding for Years 7 & 8 (July 2021- June 2023) 


## Proposal 

Continuing to build on the Big Ten Academic Alliance Geospatial Data Project’s successes in its first six years, we propose maintaining the investment level of $15,000 per institution for each of the next two years (with thirteen participating institutions, this would total $195,000 per year). The main goal for the next two years is to support and strengthen current operations and services. To accomplish that goal, we will continue to grow the collection of geospatial metadata records, develop related content for teaching and learning, and perform outreach to both data providers and consumers. To advance longer-term strategic aims of the project, such as the expansion of our partnership and service models, we are actively seeking external funding, which includes the submission of an IMLS National Leadership Grant preliminary proposal. 


## Context

The Big Ten Academic Alliance Geoportal is the only consortial geoportal maintained by collaboration between academic institutions in the United States. Only a handful of individual universities, including Stanford, Princeton, Harvard, and NYU, have been able to build a similar geoportal for their campus affiliates. As of October 2020, the BTAA Geoportal collection has grown to nearly 36,000 records allowing discovery and access for geospatial data resources from ten states within the Big Ten Academic Alliance. We also provide leadership in the Geo4LibCamp and GeoBlacklight international communities by hosting monthly meetings, contributing to the open-source code base, and forming cross-institutional workgroups.


## Progress

Over the last two years, in addition to day-to-day operations of the geoportal, we addressed several areas of focus: 

### 1. Teaching & Learning 

* [Geoportal Tutorials](../tutorials/index.md) - for use by librarians, instructors, and students
* [Help & FAQs](../guides/index.md) - to facilitate ease of use for the Geoportal
    
### 2. Outreach

* [BTAA GIS Conference](../conference/index.md) - online conference with over 400 registrants from 10 countries
* [Blog Posts](../blog/index.md) - collection highlights and data provider interviews

    
### 3. Assessment & Usage

* [Five Year Impact Report](impactReport_2020-05.md) - demonstrates the project’s qualitative effects
* Increase in monthly users year over year

    
### 4. Technology & Infrastructure

* Built a custom [geospatial metadata editor](https://github.com/BTAA-Geospatial-Data-Project/geomg)
* Contributed about 500 hours to the development of GeoBlacklight code
* Serving as the first [Community Coordinator](https://geoblacklight.org/about/) for the GeoBlacklight Community


## Future Activities

We plan to continue working on: 

* Licensed Data - will be included in the Geoportal starting in early 2021
* Additional Help Pages and Advanced Tutorials
* [Diverse Collections Working Group](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_lFlwsvqfs-Vtcr8OHoRGJA88MLApXkvY_sHR6bqOIQ/edit?usp=sharing) 


## Growth Potential

We are exploring opportunities for long term sustainability and strategic growth. Guided by a Strategic Leadership Group active from 2018-2020, we have developed a plan that expands our partnership and service models. To this end, we have submitted a preliminary proposal for an IMLS grant that would provide the funding needed to propel us to this next step.

## Project Budget

Year 7 (July 2021 - June 2022) and Year 8 (July 2022 - June 2023)

*The project has $170,000 in reserve that was previously designated for web hosting and software development (which has been provided in-kind by the University of Minnesota for Years 1-6 of the project). The previous budget (Years 5 & 6) proposed to utilize that reserve to fund an increased level of developer effort. An attempt was made to hire a developer position, but that search failed. Since April 2020, UMN has been prohibited from recruiting or appointing new positions. We intend to return to our original plan of recruiting a software developer when conditions permit.

	_Since launching in 2016, the Geoportal has had a slowly rising base of users and pageviews, with usage patterns following the academic calendar. However, there has been a marked increase in 2020, possibly attributable to the growing collection size, the shift to online instruction, and the BTAA GIS Virtual Conference._
