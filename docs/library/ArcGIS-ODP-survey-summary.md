During November 2017, we sent out a short survey to contact emails listed on 14 Open Data Portals currently represented in our collection. We received 7 responses.

Here were the questions and a summary of the responses::

**What products do you use for your Open Data portal?**

All respondents checked both boxes for this question, indicating that they used ArcGIS Online Only as well as ArcGIS Server/Enterprise. Since this question was intended to present an either/or question, the answers reveal that ArcGIS users may not know the names or specifications of overlapping product families in the Esri platforms.

**How do you publish new datasets? (check all that apply)**

Again, most respondents checked multiple or all of the available options (Publish from desktop with ArcMap, Publish from desktop with ArcGIS Pro, Publish directly with ArcGIS Online interface), which suggests to us that their workflows may not be consistent across their open data collection.

**When you update a dataset or web service do you overwrite it or publish a new one?**

This question provided more useful information as it was the first without uniform responses. Four respondents selected Overwrite (GUID stays the same), which is the ideal workflow. One respondent selected Publish new (a new GUID is generated), and two respondents indicated a mix of both. We did not ask what their parameters for what constitutes a new versus an updated dataset, which could be part of a follow up conversation.

**Does your organization create metadata for public datasets?**

All of the respondents replied yes, but only four organizations created metadata for *all* of their datasets. This again indicates that workflows or provenance may be inconsistent (i.e. they may be aggregating from other agencies.)

**What metadata standard or format does your organization use? (check all that apply)**

The replies were mixed. One organization uses ISO19139, one uses FGDC, two use both the ArcGIS Metadata Profile and FGDC, and one was not sure. Two respondents did not answer this question, which suggests that they might also be unsure.

**Do you have metadata enabled for your Portal?**

This was also a mix of answers. Three said yes, two said no, and two said unsure. This is a feature of the Open Data Portal architecture that is well documented, but might not be promoted prominently enough in the Help pages.

**Do you have any workflow documentation for metadata that you can share with us?**

None of the respondents replied that there was any metadata workflow documentation at their organization. This could be an area where the BTAA GDP could provide outreach.
