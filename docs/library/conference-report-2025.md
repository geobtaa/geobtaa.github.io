# Big Ten GIS Conference 2025 Wrap-Up Report

Issued: May 1, 2026

## Executive Summary

The fifth annual Big Ten GIS Conference, hosted virtually on April 11, 2025, set new records for participation and engagement. Organized by the Big Ten Academic Alliance Geospatial Information Network (BTAA-GIN), the event tripled registrations from 2023 and brought together students, faculty, researchers, librarians, and professionals to share innovative work and build cross-institutional connections.

## Wins at a Glance
    
* 664 registrants from 230+ institutions; presentation submissions more than doubled
* 220+ peak attendees and 262 unique participants throughout the day
* 37% student attendance, followed by state and local government professionals
* 40% from GIN member universities, with strong turnout from Michigan, Purdue, Ohio State, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Washington, and Pennsylvania State
* Opening remarks by Maurice York (BTAA) highlighted the value of Big Ten collaboration and BTAA-GIN infrastructure
* Keynote by Dr. Emily Fairfax (UMN) on climate resilience received high praise
* Workshop by Matt Forrest offered practical insights into emerging geospatial technologies
* Three sessions and lightning talk block delivered strong and diverse presentations
* BTAA-GIN resources, including the Geoportal, were promoted throughout the event

## 2025 Improvements

* A formal proposal review process improved speaker quality and representation
* A rebranded identity with consistent visuals across all materials
* Expanded outreach, including targeted emails to 72 organizations, listservs, and social

## Challenges & Lessons Learned

* Too few volunteers led to long shifts; we’ll expand the team in 2026 to reduce burnout
* Zoom Webinar limited backstage coordination; future events will revisit Zoom Events 
* Some GIN universities had minimal participation; we will set clearer expectations to ensure all 17 institutions are actively involved in planning, outreach, and execution

## Looking Ahead

The 2026 conference is scheduled for April, providing a full year of lead time. Earlier outreach—particularly to faculty—will help boost student and campus-wide participation.
The strong growth and success of this year’s event reflect the momentum of the BTAA-GIN network and its ongoing value and influence in advancing geospatial research, shared infrastructure, and collaboration across the Big Ten and beyond.
