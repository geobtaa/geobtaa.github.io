	* **Geospatial Data Citation Guide:** The committee is drafting a charter for a new working group to develop a guide for citing geospatial data, which will be promoted across BTAA institutions. This effort aligns with ongoing discussions about citation best practices and, if ready, will be promoted at the BTAA GIS Conference in April.  
	* **Service Models Collaboration & Geo4LibCamp:** The committee is exploring ways to contribute to Geo4LibCamp (May 2025\) by sharing service models and gathering insights from attendees to inform a set of recommendations.

=== "Coordination"

Note: ArcGIS Hub harvesting activities were paused in January due to updates in our GBL Admin tool and our metadata processing workflow.  

We also performed extensive cleanup on several collections:  

* Updated links; added thumbnails for all [Michigan General Land Office Plats](https://geo.btaa.org/?f%5Bdct_isPartOf_sm%5D%5B%5D=06a-03)  
* Updated links; added IIIF views and thumbnails for all [Indiana Digital Collections](https://geo.btaa.org/?f%5Bgbl_resourceClass_sm%5D%5B%5D=Maps&f%5Bschema_provider_s%5D%5B%5D=Indiana+University)  
* Ingested metadata improvements for all scanned maps, including a new field for scale and FAST compliant subjects (as directed by the FAST for Subject Terms Workgroup)

### Web Development

**GeoBlacklight Admin Enhancements**  

* Launched the Data Dictionaries feature   
* Streamlined distribution imports with a background queue
   
**Dev Geoportal UX Redesign**  

* Improved item view pages with breadcrumb navigation, buttonless sidebar, always-visible citations/downloads, and a new ‚ÄúMore Like This‚Äù feature.  
* Created a guide documenting logos, colors, typography, and web components to ensure design consistency.  
* UI/UX improvements will continue in February, with further refinements to navigation, metadata display, and code snippets.
