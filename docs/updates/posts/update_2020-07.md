Geospatial Data Project Update
July 2020

## First collection from Nebraska added

For Nebraska first contribution, we harvested over 100 new geospatial data records from NebraskaMap, the state's open data portal. There are many fun datasets and themes in this collection, including the Cowboy Trail and several types of [wildlife](https://geo.btaa.org/?f%5Bdc_subject_sm%5D%5B%5D=Biota&f%5Bdct_spatial_sm%5D%5B%5D=Nebraska) (Antelope, Elk, Bighorn Sheep, Mountain Lions, and more).

## First Data Provider Interview

We published our first of a series of Data Provider Interviews, posts designed to highlight local governments and institutions that offer open GIS data. In each interview, providers tell us about their missions and data resources.

This [https://geobtaa.github.io/gin/blog/2020/07/30/2020-07-dan-seidensticker/)   from Madison, WI. He described his work in a public agency and how having their data available in other geoportals has saved him time while bringing more exposure to it.
