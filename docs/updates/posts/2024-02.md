## Monthly Highlight: Northwestern University Joins the BTAA-GIN

![](img/northwestern.jpg){ align=left width=25%}

We are pleased to announce that Northwestern University has become a member of the Big Ten Academic Alliance Geospatial Information Network (BTAA-GIN). This addition to our network signifies a notable development in our efforts to enhance the collective resources and expertise available to our members.

*   **New Team Members from Northwestern University:** We welcome MÃ©ch Frazier, GIS Specialist, and Kelsey James Rydland, Head of Digital Scholarship & Research Data Management, from Northwestern University. 
*   **Network Expansion:** With the addition of Northwestern University, the BTAA-GIN now comprises 15 participating institutions. This expansion underscores the network's commitment to supporting geospatial research and education across the entire BTAA.
*   **Updated Participant Map:** Our [participant map](../../../about/participants) has been updated by team member Jay Bowen to include Northwestern University.
*   **Contribution of Scanned Maps:** Northwestern University has contributed 250 scanned maps from their Digital Collections to the BTAA Geoportal. These contributions are from their "16th-Early 20th Century Maps of Africa" and "Maps and Atlases" collections. These maps are now accessible through the BTAA-GIN portal [here](https://geo.btaa.org/?f%5Bdct_isPartOf_sm%5D%5B%5D=15d-01).

### Development

* We started a [Technology Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/geobtaa/projects/17) for the calendar year 2024 to prioritize our needs for a geodata collection pilot.
* We added a facet to filter maps that have been georeferenced.
* We updated the display of complex geometries in the location inset. Now, the rectangular bounding box appears as a dotted line, with the item exent as a solid polygon.
