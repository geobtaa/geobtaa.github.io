# July 2025 Program Status Update

## Introducing Our New Strategic Technology Plan

![Overview diagram of proposed BTAA-GIN technology stack](img/techplan2025.png){ width="550"; align=right }

As the [BTAA Geoportal](https://geo.btaa.org/) continues to grow, so do the demands on our technology. With the recent expansion of the Big Ten and the addition of new geospatial resources from the West Coast, we saw an opportunity to explore more modern and flexible ways to manage our collections. The result is a new Strategic Technology Plan: a roadmap for building a technology stack that is modular, resilient, and future-ready.
 <!-- more -->
The most exciting feature of this new approach is a central metadata API. This feature will make it easier than ever to access and reuse our geospatial records. The API will support multiple discovery portals and access points, and we are even using it to develop a QGIS data discovery plugin!
 <!-- more -->
 As part of this shift, we are moving away from a large, all-in-one geoportal application toward a more flexible, modular framework built on open-source Python tools. This new structure makes it easier to update individual components and empowers us to think bigger: to prioritize data over tools, to collaborate better across institutions, and to build infrastructure that can adapt and grow over time. 
 <!-- more -->
Our [2025-26 roadmap](https://gin.btaa.org/technology/tech-plan-2025) encompasses four projects that will put this plan into action. Development is already underway, with full rollout planned by mid-2026. Stay tuned as we share updates!

### Workgroups

<div class="grid" markdown>


=== "Geodata Collection Workgroup"

	* Aligned on the Urban Base Layers initiative, identifying seven foundational city-scale datasets shared across major metro areas in Big Ten states—a focused strategy that supports both high-quality curation and regional scalability.
	* Confirmed Minneapolis as the first data provider partner to approach, paving the way for partnership-based data collection and future collaboration with additional cities.

=== "Service Model Collaboration Workgroup"

	* Work on the final report continued asynchronously with the plan of finalizing the report in time to share at the August program team meeting.

=== "Geospatial Data Citation Workgroup"

	* Did not meet
