# March 2024 Program Status Update



## Monthly Highlight

We had the honor of being invited by Yale University Libraries to present our expertise in GeoBlacklight, OpenGeoMetadata, and the BTAA Geoportal to their Associate University Librarians. Our overview included development requirements, metadata strategies, collaboration successes, and our recommended priorities. 

Our slides are below:

Feedback afterwards indicated that we positively influenced Yale's decision to recommit to their geoportal development with an elevated focus on geospatial metadata.
