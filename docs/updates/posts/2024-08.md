# August 2024 Program Status Update

## Monthly Highlight: Priority Project Matrix

![Allmaps.](img/priority-projects.png){ width=300; align=left}
  
This year, the BTAA-GIN has adopted a new Priority Projects model to streamline our work and focus on the most impactful goals. We began by collecting 17 project suggestions, which we prioritized using a matrix that considered factors such as project ownership, volunteer availability, DEIA relevance, time commitment, and difficulty. This matrix, inspired by the Minnesota Geospatial Advisory Council's workflows, helped us assess each project's likelihood of success. We then had team members vote on the importance of each project, creating a value score. By multiplying the likelihood of success by the value score, we categorized the projects into five high priority, six medium, and six low priority. Each committee has been assigned multiple projects, with some tasks designated for dedicated workgroups and others for individuals, including the Product Manager and a new hire.

The projects, along with their priority, owner, and status, are publicly available on our [GitHub project board](https://github.com/orgs/geobtaa/projects/22/views/6).

### August Harvesting Activities

{{ read_csv('tables/harvests_2024-08.csv') }}

### Development

* Development in August primarily revolved around the GeoBlacklight Summer Community Sprint, which focused on upgrading backend frameworks in anticipation of releasing a new major version (5.0).

* Excessive bot/AI web scraping traffic crashed our development Geoportal and UMN Web Development had to spend extra time to block the crawlers.

## Next Steps

Projects that are currently in progress or up next include:

* Create or update policies and disclaimers for the Geoportal
* Continue the Geodata Pilot
* Kickoff three new workgroups: implementing FAST subjects;  Scalable Approaches; Service Models
