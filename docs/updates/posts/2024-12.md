This expansion highlights our commitment to supporting geospatial research and education across the BTAA. As one of the largest collaborations of its kind in the field of GIS, our network continues to grow in size and value, amplifying its positive impact on geospatial data and research.
* *A History of Collaboration*: For over 9 years, the BTAA-GIN has exemplified academic collaboration, creating opportunities and driving innovation in geospatial services and tools across its member universities. The integration of these two renowned universities further boosts our shared influence and available resources.

### Development

**Ongoing Bot Traffic Issues**

Like many other rich-content websites, the Geoportal has lately been overwhelmed by AI bots, causing major slowdowns and outages. We have blocked traffic from certain regions, but the problem persists globally. A stronger security system, like a web application firewall, is a top priority for 2025.

**Improved Data Organization**

Our introduction of stored assets complicated our established workflow for adding links, such as downloads, supplemental metadata, and external website addresses. To improve our metadata management, we overhauled our GBL Admin database to migrate these links into a separate table. In addition to simplifying our descriptive metadata workflow, this separation allows us to use structured fields to describe the links.

**Work In-progress**

* Implementing data dictionaries.  
* Preparing for necessary server and framework updates in early 2025.

## Next Steps

* Kickoff the BTAA GIS Conference planning group.  
* Sunset the Geodata Pilot Working Group and charge one for the next phase.  
* Provide a Technology overview training for new Team Members.  
* Prepare a survey of GIN members on current service models.
