# February 2025 Program Status Update

## Building a Sustainable Geodata Repository: BTAA-GIN Pilot Phase Complete

![Lantern logo](img/lantern.png){ width="300"; align=right }

The BTAA-GIN Geodata Pilot Workgroup has successfully completed its current phase, establishing the technical and metadata infrastructure for a scalable geospatial repository. Over the past year (Q1 2024â€“Q1 2025), the workgroup focused on building a framework for data curation, refining metadata standards, and improving workflow automation.

ðŸ“Œ [**Read the full report here**](https://gin.btaa.org/library/geodata-collection-goundwork-report/)

### Key Accomplishments

* curated a pilot collection of 35 datasets on our development site to test our processes for gathering, describing, and sharing geospatial information
* added new metadata fields and entry guidelines to provide technical and administrative documentation for datasets
* created new methods for programmatically generating metadata and derivative files from collected datasets
* introduced new ways for users to evaluate datasets with visual previews and data dictionaries

### Next Step

The next phase, **Foundation (2025â€“26),** will feature our activites to:

* partner with data providers to develop a process for exchanging resources
* continue to enhance the BTAA Geoportal and backend management tools
* curate real-world data submissions to build our first official collections
* release a formal plan that documents our goals, workflows, and guidelines

## Program Activities

### Committees

<div class="grid" markdown>


=== "TECHnology"

	* Reviewed new item page design.  
	* Previewed the draft Strategic Technology Plan 2025-2026.  
	* Reviewed candidates for potential data preservation/rescue and discussed the benefits of establishing a workgroup to update the collection development policy.

=== "Community Engagement"

	* Shared a list of potential candidates for the geospatial data archiving pilot and government data rescue with the Tech Committee.  
	* Completed two sprints to storyboard videos introducing GIN and providing Geoportal walkthroughs.


=== "Knowledge"

	* Proposed discussing and brainstorming at-risk state datasets for the geospatial data archiving pilot at the next Program Team meeting as well as initiating a workgroup to align this with our mission and workflows.  
	* Still seeking members for the [Geospatial Data Citation group](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JaHoM19eeUxMFeayJzVU6XP4PD9EX3Dob7Gfxwiekuo/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.q847yh9hguay).  
	* Transactions in GIS CFP on spatial data sharing presents a potential publication opportunity tied to data citation, platform promotion, and data privacy, with a discussion planned for the 3/13 Program Team meeting.

=== "Coordination"

	* Reviewed drafts of two new documents  
	     * Strategic Technology Plan 2025-2026  
	     * Geodata Collection Groundwork Phase Report  
	* Onboarding of new members is ongoing. USC will participate in our monthly meetings until a final membership decision is made in July 2025.  
	* Our annual conference has a new name: Big Ten GIS Conference 2025. Promotion for the Call for Proposals & Maps begins this month.
