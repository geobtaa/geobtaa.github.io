# December 2023 Program Status Update

## Monthly Highlight

### Our Program Website Has a New Home!

We migrated of our program website from Google Sites to a static site hosted on GitHub. This move brings several key benefits:

<!-- more -->

:scales: **Enhanced Accessibility & Stability**: Our content is now more accessible, presented in user-friendly HTML, authored in versatile Markdown, moving beyond the restrictions of Google Docs and Slides.

:fontawesome-solid-person-walking-luggage: **Future-Proofing**: With Markdown and HTML's universal compatibility, we're poised for easy transitions to new templates or platforms. We have transitioned to a custom BTAA subdomain, stepping away from the UMN-branded Google Site address, which will ensure persistent links.

:art: **Creative Control**: We now have greater flexibility in site design, leveraging custom CSS and Javascript, a feature limited in Google Sites.
