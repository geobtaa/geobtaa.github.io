# April 2025 Program Status Update

## Monthly Highlight: Big Ten GIS Conference 2025 Sees Strong Growth

![BTAA in FAST](img/conf25-registrations.png){ width="450"; align=right }

The fifth annual **Big Ten GIS Conference**, held virtually on April 11, 2025, marked a milestone for BTAA-GIN. With 664 registrants from 230+ institutions, the event tripled registration from the previous year and drew participants from academia, libraries, government, and research communities.

Keynote speaker Dr. Emily Fairfax (UMN) delivered a widely praised talk on beavers and climate resilience. Three themed sessions and a lightning talk block showcased diverse work from students, professionals, and faculty.
 <!-- more -->
A twofold increase in presentation proposals led to a new formal review process, including anonymous evaluation and attention to balance across institutions and topics.
 <!-- more -->
This year, the conference moved from its traditional November date to April to avoid conflicts with GIS Day. The record-breaking turnout suggests April is far more accessible. **Save the date—April 2026**—and look for faculty outreach to begin in fall 2025.

The success of the 2025 conference reflects BTAA-GIN’s growing visibility and influence in shaping shared geospatial infrastructure and collaboration across the Big Ten and beyond.

### Launch of _Coordinates_
BTAA-GIN also launched its new quarterly newsletter, _Coordinates_, in April. The first issue was sent to 700 recipients, including conference participants, GIN members, and key stakeholders. The newsletter provides regular updates, highlights member contributions, and promotes collaboration across the network. <a href="https://mailchi.mp/d146395039e5/coordinates-from-btaa-gin-signup-page">**Sign-up here to receive _Coordinates_**</a>.
