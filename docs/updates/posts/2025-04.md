# April 2025 Program Status Update

## Monthly Highlight: Big Ten GIS Conference 2025 Sees Strong Growth

![BTAA in FAST](img/conf25-registrations.png){ width="300"; align=right }

The fifth annual **Big Ten GIS Conference**, held virtually on April 11, 2025, marked a milestone for BTAA-GIN. With 664 registrants from 113 institutions, the event tripled registration from the previous year and drew participants from academia, libraries, government, and research communities.

Keynote speaker Dr. Emily Fairfax (UMN) delivered a widely praised talk on beavers and climate resilience. Three themed sessions and a lightning talk block showcased diverse work from students, professionals, and faculty.
 <!-- more -->
A twofold increase in presentation proposals led to a new formal review process, including anonymous evaluation and attention to balance across institutions and topics.
 <!-- more -->
This year, the conference moved from its traditional November date to April to avoid conflicts with GIS Day. The record-breaking turnout suggests April is far more accessible. **Save the date—April 2026**—and look for faculty outreach to begin in fall 2025.

The success of the 2025 conference reflects BTAA-GIN’s growing visibility and influence in shaping shared geospatial infrastructure and collaboration across the Big Ten and beyond.

### Launch of _Coordinates_
BTAA-GIN also launched its new quarterly newsletter, _Coordinates_, in April. The first issue was sent to 700 recipients, including conference participants, GIN members, and key stakeholders. The newsletter provides regular updates, highlights member contributions, and promotes collaboration across the network. <a href="https://mailchi.mp/d146395039e5/coordinates-from-btaa-gin-signup-page">**Sign-up here to receive _Coordinates_**</a>.
