# May 2025 Program Status Update

## Monthly Highlight: BTAA-GIN Poster Presented at ACRL 2025: Sustaining a Spatial Collaboration

![Poster presented at ACRL 2025: ‘Sustaining a Spatial Collaboration’ by Mattke, Majewicz, and Tickner](img/acrlposter.png){ width="450"; align=right }

At the 2025 Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) Conference in Minneapolis, BTAA-GIN members Ryan Mattke, Karen Majewicz, and Amanda Tickner presented a poster highlighting the program’s evolution and the social infrastructure that underpins its long-term success.
 <!-- more -->
 Titled _Sustaining a Spatial Collaboration: Leveraging Social Infrastructure to Support Technological Growth__, the poster traces the development of BTAA-GIN from an informal network into a nationally recognized initiative. It emphasizes that while technological innovation—such as the BTAA Geoportal—has been critical, the program’s staying power lies in the strong, collaborative community built across institutions.
 <!-- more -->
**Key Themes**
 *Trust, shared governance, and cross-institutional relationships as foundations for sustainable growth
 *Real-world lessons from maintaining open-source infrastructure across diverse academic environments
 *The evolving role of libraries in advancing geospatial research and discovery
 <!-- more -->
**Next Steps**
The themes explored in the poster are shaping current priorities as BTAA-GIN prepares to launch a rebuilt geoportal and move into its next strategic phase. These insights will help ensure that both the technology and the community supporting it continue to grow together.

## Program Activities

### Committees

<div class="grid" markdown>


=== "TECHnology"

	* Held retrospective discussion on April Data Rescue sprint with Tech and Knowledge Cmtes.
	* Next steps: Working to get the BTAA-GIN listed as a “maintainer” in the Data Rescue Project and to add three records to their dataset tracker: NOAA Heat Watch, NCES Edge Hub site, HUD Hub site.

=== "Community Engagement"

	* Completed a series of video walkthroughs of the Geoportal for discovering and opening resources that demonstrates all of the search features and filters. Next step is sharing them with the full GIN.
	* Summer plan is to update slides for introducing the Geoportal to classes.
