## Geo4LibCamp 2025: Reimagining Community and Technology in Geospatial Libraries

![Geo4LibCamp 2025 attendees](img/geo4libcamp2025.png){ width="550"; align=right }

Held in May at the University of Minnesota, Geo4LibCamp 2025 convened over 20 software developers, librarians, curators, researchers, and administrators to share strategies and tools shaping the future of geospatial data services. This year marked a turning point—not just in technology, but in redefining the community’s scope, structure, and identity.
 <!-- more -->
 The event centered on key questions: Who is this community for? How should it evolve? And how do we better support geospatial librarians and adjacent roles? The answer: broaden participation and build sustainability from the ground up.
