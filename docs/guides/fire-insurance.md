# Fire Insurance Maps Research Guide


## What are Fire Insurance maps?

!!! quote

	“The Sanborn map collection consists of a uniform series of large-scale maps, dating from 1867 to the present and depicting the commercial, industrial, and residential sections of some twelve thousand cities and towns in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The maps were designed to assist fire insurance agents in determining the degree of hazard associated with a particular property and therefore show the size, shape, and construction of dwellings, commercial buildings, and factories as well as fire walls, locations of windows and doors, sprinkler systems, and types of roofs. The maps also indicate widths and names of streets, property boundaries, building use, and house and block numbers.”  -- [Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps, Library of Congress ](https://www.loc.gov/rr/geogmap/sanborn/san4a1.html)

Each city coverage begins with a graphic index to guide the user to the correct page with each page only covering a few blocks. The original paper maps used color to indicate building materials such as yellow for wood construction and pink for brick.  Some newer maps have “paste on” updates or corrections applied to a base map.  Note the correction record on the index key page for dates.  While Sanborn maps do not show property owner names, they can show business names.  For more information, see the [Library of Congress’ Introduction to the Sanborn Collection](https://www.loc.gov/rr/geogmap/sanborn/san4a1.html).

## How can I find maps in the BTAA Geoportal?

Because they are a popular research resource, fire insurance maps have been scanned and made available in a variety of ways, some under commercial license provided by a library purchase or subscription. Additionally, some libraries have scanned and made their own maps freely available.  

* In the Geoportal search box, search for your town name.
* Then select “Fire insurance maps” in the Resource Type facet in the left ribbon.


### Which Platform Should I Use? 

There is no single resource that has all the maps in one location.  Penn State University Libraries has made all their maps of Pennsylvania available through the Geoportal. Additional free resources are described below.

For other states, you will get an entry point to two state level subscription products: Digital Sanborn Maps (Black & White): 1687-1970 and Fire Insurance Maps Online (FiMO). Your institution may or may not subscribe to the product listed. If you do not have subscription access through your institution, try the [Library of Congress Sanborn map collection](https://www.loc.gov/collections/sanborn-maps) or your state library may have a subscription.

If your town name search doesn’t turn anything up in the geoportal, you can still try searching by state and then seeing if the town shows up geographically where you would expect it to.  Remember, only town centers (i.e. populated places) and industrial sites were mapped, but also that smaller towns or neighborhoods may be mapped with larger towns.  For example, East Lansing, MI is in the Lansing Sanborn map, but not listed as an East Lansing map.

<sup>1</sup>The ProQuest Digital Sanborn Maps description:  This resource provides detailed information about city properties including all the buildings, their addresses, and in commercial areas the type of business establishment in each building. Each town center was mapped one or even several times between 1870-1960. Each volume begins with a graphic index to guide the user to the correct page; each page only covers a few city blocks. This database is black-and-white only, while the original paper maps used color to indicate building materials.

<sup>2</sup>Fire Insurance Maps Online (FIMO) Database description: This resource contains full color detailed maps of numerous towns and cities, however generally of only the more densely settled parts of each place. They contain detailed information about city properties including building characteristics, their

addresses, and in commercial areas the type of business establishment in each building. Each

town center was mapped one or even several times between 1870-1960. Most content is from

the Sanborn Fire Insurance Company, but this growing database will continue to add fire

insurance maps from other publishers and other large scale maps. The database is searchable

by address, by coordinates, or by a clickable map interface.

<sup>3</sup>Penn State University Libraries’ Sanborn digital collection: The University Libraries' Center for Maps and Geospatial Information has a near complete collection of Sanborn Fire Insurance maps for the state of Pennsylvania. The digital collection will continue to grow as maps come out of copyright.  As not all maps have been loaded into the geoportal, the entire collection can be accessed at[ Penn State University Libraries](https://libraries.psu.edu/about/collections/sanborn-fire-insurance-maps).

### Search Tips

Occasionally a suburb will not be mapped as its own town but will be included in the back volumes of the larger city. Make sure you check nearby town names if you aren’t finding the one you are searching for.

Large cities will be mapped over many, many volumes.  Each volume will begin with an index showing what is included in that volume.
