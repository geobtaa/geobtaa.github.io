# Research Guides

Our Research Guides provide help on using the BTAA Geoportal as well as general finding aids for topical resources.

## Using the BTAA Geoportal

[**BTAA Geoportal search strategies**](search-strategies.md): Start here to learn how to search for resources in the [BTAA Geoportal](https://geo.btaa.org)

[**Understanding metadata**](understanding-metadata.md): This brief video tutorial defines what geospatial metadata is and how Geoportal users can locate and interact with it.

[**Citing geospatial data**](cite-data.md): This guide discusses data citation options and how to use the Cite widget in the BTAA Geoportal.

[**Licensed data**](licensed-data.md): Most of the resources in the BTAA Geoportal are free and open, but we also include an index of licensed databases commonly accessed by researchers affiliated with a BTAA university.  The Licensed Data research guide explains how to interpret those records and access the data.

## Topical Guides
