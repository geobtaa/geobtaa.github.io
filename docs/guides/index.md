Our Research Guides provide help on using the BTAA Geoportal as well as general finding aids for topical resources.

## Using the BTAA Geoportal

[**Licensed data**](licensed-data.md): Most of the resources in the BTAA Geoportal are free and open, but we also include an index of licensed databases commonly accessed by researchers affiliated with a BTAA university.  The Licensed Data research guide explains how to interpret those records and access the data.
