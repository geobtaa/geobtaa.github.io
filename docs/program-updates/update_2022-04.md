# Project Highlight: Adding resources in response to current events in Ukraine

:fontawesome-solid-user: By Karen Majewicz

Our collection development efforts typically focus on geodata and maps that are created and held by institutions located in Big Ten states. However, we also make an effort to meet the research needs of users, particularly in response to current events. In the past, we sought out and added  [Covid-19](https://geo.btaa.org/?searchfield=allfields&q=covid)  and  [racial equity](https://geo.btaa.org/?f%5Bschemaproviders%5D%5B%5D=Racial+Equity+GIS+Hub)  resources.

<!-- more -->

In response to the invasion of Ukraine, we added  [new geodata from Stanford University of Ukrainian boundaries](https://geo.btaa.org/?f%5Bdctspatialsm%5D%5B%5D=Ukraine&f%5BgblresourceClasssm%5D%5B%5D=Datasets&f%5Bschemaproviders%5D%5B%5D=Stanford&f2=publisher&f3=title&f4=placename&op2=AND&op3=AND&op4=AND&q2=&q3=&q4=&range%5BgblindexYearim%5D%5Bbegin%5D=&range%5BgblindexYearim%5D%5Bend%5D=&searchfield=advanced)  and  [two interactive websites](https://geo.btaa.org/?f%5BgblresourceClasssm%5D%5B%5D=Websites&f1=title&f2=publisher&f3=title&f4=placename&op2=AND&op3=AND&op4=AND&q1=Ukraine&q2=&q3=&q4=&range%5BgblindexYearim%5D%5Bbegin%5D=&range%5BgblindexYearim%5D%5Bend%5D=&searchfield=advanced)  that are tracking the events. We also identified numerous information resources that do not fit into the Geoportal collection for reasons of being ephemeral or nonspatial. These information resources have been listed and summarized in a  [March blog post](https://geobtaa.blogspot.com/2022/03/ukraine-maps-and-data.html) .
