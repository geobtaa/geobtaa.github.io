# Mapping Chicagoland

:fontawesome-solid-user: By Karen Majewicz

Cecilia Smith, our program team member from the University of Chicago, led a team that received a successful $348,930 National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) grant in April for the proposal “ Mapping Chicagoland .” <!-- more --> The project is a partnership between the University of Chicago Library, the Chicago History Museum, and Newberry Library to digitize historical maps of Chicago through 1940. In addition to the [UChicago Library website](https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/) and [Chicago Collections Consortium](https://chicagocollections.org/), the BTAA Geoportal was cited in the grant as one of the platforms where the maps will be made available. The collaboration will involve scanning, adding spatial data, creating metadata, and sharing 4,101 digitized maps in the Fall of 2024.
