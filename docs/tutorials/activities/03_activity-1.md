##### Learning objective: 

* Frame a search strategy for geospatial data based on your research question and anticipated data needs.


## Instructions

Take a few minutes, and write down some notes related to the questions below to frame your search strategy for geospatial data. The **What**, **Where**, and **When** questions will help you determine the initial scope of your data needs. The **Who** questions will help you brainstorm some potential sources for beginning your search.

### What

Ask yourself questions like:

* What is my research question, and what types of analysis am I planning to carry out?
* What data will I need to address this question or carry out this analysis?
* What types of data am I seeking (e.g., vector, raster, tabular)?
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

### Where

Ask yourself questions like:

* What geographic area(s) am I studying?
* What spatial scale/resolution am I planning to use for my analysis, and is this realistic?
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

### When

Ask yourself questions like:

* What time period(s) am I studying?
* Is my analysis based on a single point in time, or am I planning to compare data across multiple time periods?
* What is my desired periodicity for data collection (e.g., monthly, annually, every decade), and is this realistic?
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

### Who

Ask yourself questions like:

* Who is likely to care about this research topic and associated datasets?
* Who has published on this topic, and what data did they use?
* What government agencies, educational institutions, non-profits, research centers, commercial entities, or other organizations might collect and distribute these data?
