##### Learning objectives:

* Perform a search for geospatial data in the BTAA Geoportal using the text, map, and facet searching features of that system.
* Determine how to access relevant geospatial datasets using the BTAA Geoportal based on the results of your search process.

## Instructions

### 1. In 1-2 sentences, briefly describe your research question or topic.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
### 2. Access the Big Ten Academic Alliance Geoportal at: [https://geo.btaa.org/](https://geo.btaa.org/).
<br>
### 3. Based on your articulated research question or topic, start by performing a [text-based search (i.e., keywords)](https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/btaa-gdp/help/how-to-use-the-btaa-geoportal#h.p_23WAhqSUrRrW).
<br> Explore your initial results. If your search returns relevant results, open the [item page](https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/btaa-gdp/help/how-to-use-the-btaa-geoportal#h.p_e8issoLgre31) for a few of those records to examine in more detail. For this search, answer the following questions:
<br>
<br>
#### What search terms did you use?
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
#### Did your search return relevant results?If so, record the title(s) for the relevant dataset(s) in the space below.
 <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>        
#### What did you learn from examining the item page?  Describe the ways these data are accessible (e.g., web services, direct download).
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
#### If not, what other search terms might return more relevant results? Try a second keyword search using these new terms, and explore these new results. Record your new search terms and the title(s) for any relevant dataset(s).
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
### 4. Return to the BTAA Geoportal homepage, and perform a [map-based search (using option 1)](https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/btaa-gdp/help/how-to-use-the-btaa-geoportal#h.p_7p2W7hkqsEa2).
<br>
Examine your initial results. If your search returns relevant results, open the item page for a few of those records to examine in more detail. Record the title(s) for the relevant dataset(s) in the space below.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>    
Return to your search results page. Use one or more of the facets available on the left side of the page to [refine your search results](https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/btaa-gdp/help/how-to-use-the-btaa-geoportal#h.p_4hbj0ETHrUBp).
<br>
#### What facet(s) did you use to refine your search? Was this approach helpful in narrowing down your results to more relevant datasets?
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
#### Record the title(s) for any relevant datasets in the space below.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
#### Examine the item page for one of these datasets. Describe the ways these data are accessible (e.g., web services, direct download).
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
### 5. To wrap up, briefly describe your next steps.

####If you located relevant datasets for your project, are there additional searches that you plan to perform in the BTAA Geoportal to try to find other relevant datasets? What types of searches are you planning?
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>        
#### For datasets youâ€™ve already located, how will you go about accessing them and evaluating them for use in your project?
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>    
#### If you did not locate relevant datasets for your project, are there other searches that you might try in the BTAA Geoportal to find more relevant results? What types of searches?
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>  
#### If the BTAA Geoportal is unlikely to match your data needs for this project, what other options might be available to you? What other sources do you plan to explore next for finding relevant datasets?
