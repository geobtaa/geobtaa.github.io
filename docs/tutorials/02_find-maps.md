## Downloading and placing images

* When you go to the source for a map image, look for options to download - this will usually give you better quality.
* If no download widget displays, right click on the map image to bring up a box with options to copy, view, and/or save.

### Placing images in a document

* Place in document (Word, PowerPoint, Google Document, Google Slides, etc.) like you would any other image.

## Copyright and fair use

!!! warning

	But wait, you can’t just use every image freely and in any way you want….you need to determine if an image is copyrighted.
	
	
Here is a 5¢ tour of determining whether you can use an image. However, you should ask your instructor or librarian questions to be sure your use is okay.

Even if the ORIGINAL is older (such as our 1750 map example), the scan of the item is covered by copyright.

Assume all images online are copyrighted unless:

* It is from a FEDERAL US Government source (items from state and local government sources may be copyrighted)
* There is another statement of rights, such as a Creative Commons license.

So, can you use it?

Generally, if you’re using it just in a class presentation or in an assignment submitted to your instructor, your use of the map would likely be considered fair use and acceptable.
If your content is posted online for wider distribution, such as in a journal article or electronic thesis, this would NOT be considered fair use and you likely cannot use a copyrighted image without seeking permission from whoever owns the image.
